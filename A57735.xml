         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE PIOUS READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Treatiſe here preſented to thine eyes firſt ſounded in the ears of a gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety by that Goſpel-Trumpet, Mr. <hi>John Row.</hi> It was a Darling-child brought forth from a judicious head and a ſanctified heart. The Ancients compared <hi>John</hi> to the Eagle in the Viſion of Cherubims, becauſe ſoaring high in the contemplation of our Lords Divinity. Our <hi>John,</hi> as if he had lain in the boſom of that <hi>John,</hi> who lay in the boſom of our Saviour, hath ſweetly attempted to deſcant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Song of Angels about the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Heaven and Earth, God and man together.
<note place="margin">Luk. 2.10.</note> The heavenly Hoſt anſwered in a heavenly Anthem to that ſingle Angel, who brought the good Tydings of great joy for all people to the Shepherds of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and behold here one of the Shepherds of <hi>Zion</hi> ſings his <hi>Epiphonema</hi> to theirs, <hi>Glory to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt.</hi> Indeed the union of two Natures in one Perſon, and of three Perſons in one Eſſence are Myſteries un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable by Angels: but the joy of its influence ſhall never forſake the Harps of Angels or Saints to all Eternity. None but who is aſſumed into that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion can exhauſt the Treaſury of Divine Wiſdom.
<note place="margin">Rev. 5.5.</note> 
               <hi>John</hi> the beloved Diſciple could not unlooſe the ſeven Seals of theſe Myſteries, but muſt weep at the foot of the Lamb to do it. Yet what is to be believed, admired, adored, may and ought to be the ſubject of our moſt profound Meditations and
<pb facs="tcp:99997:3"/>delight. What God hath revealed let none preſume to count impertinent to dive into, though they can feel no bottom: they will find more amiable Gemms than Pearl and Coral adhering to the ſides of the adamantine Rocks in this unfathomable Abyſs. True, none can fully explain this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion but he that injoys it. To delineate ſome glittering rays that ſtream from it, requires deep communion with the perſon in union. We are not able to conjecture what pleaſures flow in upon the palates of Angels, as they ſtand drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the beams of the Divine Eſſence, neither can they transfuſe or pour out thoſe Paradiſe-rivers into our broken ciſterns. How far this holy man hath added to the point, I rather leave to the Candidates of theſe Myſteries, than determine. Each may ſee deeper into their own Notions than others, and it is far eaſier to conceive than expreſs; and yet there is infinitely more left for all Ages in the remainder of the Spirit, than ever was uttered, or can be thought of. Yet I think, with reſpect had to others, he hath rendred ſome things more intelligible, and many things more applicable and uſeful to common capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</p>
            <p>The Cherubims that ſtood looking down upon the crowned Mercy-ſeat might <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, they might gaze upon it, but not through it. It was not tranſparent Gold like the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21.21.</note> but too thick a plate of Ophir for an Angels eye to pierce. They may pry into the ſtate of Saints in Glory, but not the contrivance of Grace to bring Saints thither. Much leſs can man, and man fallen, receive or ſuſtain wings ſtrong enough to fly into the depth of this amazing Firmament. What God bath made on the back-ſide of the exteriour Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens hath a terminating bound, becauſe a Creature:
<pb facs="tcp:99997:3"/>though it poſe Aſtronomy it ſelf to meaſure and ſquare the Circle of the Heavens: ſo what God hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is infinitely true, though our finite and crooked thoughts can never unfold or draw a parallel what Scripture reveals; though it do not fully unveil, it is our duty both to ſtudy and embrace. Divine love, ſay the Platoniſts, made the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, and therefore more capacious; and were it not more comprehenſive than all created love, it would never take a Saint. He finds a bottom in all created joy, and not like the Sea, the freſher at the bottom, but ſometimes more ſalt and bitter: but uncreated love hath no ſhoars nor centre, but the boſom of God and the depth is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, ſtill higher and ſweeter. Theſe things are reſerved for ſuch as paſs <hi>Kidron</hi> and <hi>Olivet:</hi> let us a while ſtep into the Sanctuary, and ſtudy to grow in the Myſtery of the Father and of Chriſt, and pray that the Spirit would reveal in us what the Son hath revealed to us from the Father,

               </note> and then draw ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and ſweet conſequences from above.</p>
            <p>Did the Son of God come down from Heaven to earth, was it not to take the ſons of men from earth to Heaven? Did not the ſecond Perſon partake of the humane Nature, that we might partake of the Divine? He took not the perſons of <hi>Enoch,</hi> or <hi>Abraham,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> that they only might be happy; but the nature of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that all who by faith are united to the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> in Grace, may triumph in Glory. Did not he lye in <hi>Davids</hi> Inn at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> that we might lye in the Son of <hi>Davids</hi> manſions that are above in that <hi>Zion</hi> of <hi>Zions?</hi> Was not he made of a woman in <hi>Canaan</hi> to reſtore us to a better Paradiſe than what was loſt by the woman of <hi>Eden?</hi> Was not he made under the Law, that we might be new born under Grace? Was not he exalted
<pb facs="tcp:99997:4"/>on the Croſs; this <hi>Joſephs</hi> Son, to ſpeak with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to erect a more firm and ſublime Ladder into Heaven, than <hi>Jacob</hi>'s? That Patriarch <hi>ſaw</hi> only a Viſion of Angels by ſtar-light; but we by this Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>aſcend</hi> up to the Angels themſelves, that are ſinging in the Noon of Glory. Was not his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood poured out as a Ranſom for many to the remiſſion of ſins, that ours might not be poured out like oyl to feed the perpetual Lamps in the flames of Hell? Did not the Father make his love honourable (as the Prophet ſpeaks) by his Son's more honourable obedience, and juſtifie his Juſtice by his Son's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and quench his anger in the Ocean of his Son's love? Thus doth our bleſſed Author from the Son's Deity proceed to the great Doctrine of his moſt meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sufferings and full Satisfaction for the ſins of all the Elect. The Father by his Eternal love made way for his Temporal anger to his beloved Son, that he might redeem his adopted ſons from eternal wrath, and made a way through the heart of his Son for them to paſs into eternal love. This point he no leſs ſweetly than ſubſtantially clears againſt the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians venom, who aim by darkning the Deity of Chriſt to extinguiſh the glory and honour of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
<note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> For if it had not been the Blood of God, it could never have purchaſed the Church. But it is that glorious Perſon,
<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> who having by himſelf purged our ſins, ſate down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high.
<note place="margin">Rev. 1.5.</note> He who is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham</hi> was, the firſt and the laſt, who is, was, and is to come, hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own Blood, and hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God, even his Father: to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not proceed by Arguments to evince this
<pb facs="tcp:99997:4"/>great Scripture-truth, which hath been ſo oppugned both by ancient and modern Hereticks, and ſo nobly vindicated by Primitive Councils and Fathers, and by nervous and learned Pens of latter days. <hi>Polyae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> in his Roman Stratagems is but a wrigling ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm to this old Serpent in his direful Arts, who like a Revelation-Scorpion carries death both in head and tail: to bite with the teeth of fiery lyes, and with his perſecuting tail to ſlaſh the third part of the Stars out of the Heaven of the Church. This Hydra hath not only hiſſed, but mortally ſtung many a Soul in the Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian, Hungarian, Tranſylvanian, and Belgick Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: and I could hearily wiſh had never ſwum after <hi>Pelagius</hi> through the Britiſh Seas with whole folio's tyed about its neck, to lay its poiſonous eggs in our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries. The Lord ſpeedily cruſh them in pieces, that they may never hatch into fiery flying Serpents, to provoke the Lord to vengeance. What Country in <hi>Europe</hi> hath ſweltred under more tearing ſcourges, bitter State-confuſions and convulſions, and dreadful ſhakings than <hi>Poland?</hi> where it had firſt principal vent and patronage. And how far the Belgian Lion hath had his nails pared, and his teeth knockt out by that hammer of Gods wrath in <hi>Europe</hi> ſince the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of thoſe blaſphemous Treatiſes, I wiſh both they and we did ſeriouſly lay to heart.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God for the many Champions ſent out of <hi>Iſraels</hi> Camp againſt <hi>Goliah</hi> of <hi>Gath</hi> in the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches abroad and at home. It may prove ſome mitigation of Divine diſpleaſure, and a prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our tranquillity; and I heartily pray, that godly Magiſtrates would ſtir up their ſtrength againſt it, and put to their ſeal and ſanction.

<pb facs="tcp:99997:5"/>eſtabliſhment of others in that grand point of Chriſts Satisfaction. The Lord of the everlaſting Covenant I pray to ſprinkle both this Book and all the People with the precious Blood of the Croſs:

               <note place="margin">Lev. 16.4.</note> Like as the High-Prieſt of old, being cloathed only in linen, went into the holy of Holies with the expiation-blood in a golden Baſon; but came out in all his gorgeous attire to bleſs the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
<note place="margin">Verſ. 23.</note> ſo did the glorious High-Prieſt of our profeſſion enter into the Heavens, not in ſo conſpicuous a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, being ſeen but of few, when he aſcended from Mount <hi>Olivet;</hi> but when he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified by the preſentment of his Blood, and Interceſſion to the Father, will come again in all his Royalty, and receive us to the manſions pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and prepared for them,
<note place="margin">Zech. 6.13.</note> and will ſit down as King and Prieſt upon his Throne for ever.</p>
            <p>But not to prevent your progreſs from the threſhold into the lovely Building of this Treatiſe, compoſed by a Perſon of great worth and approbation in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt, pray give me leave in the Porch to point at ſome material things reſpecting this holy Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.

<pb facs="tcp:99997:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>and ſomewhat ſmiling: his geſtures grave and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: his behaviour meek and courteous; and what is very obſervable and much to be imitated,

            <p>As to his Studies, letting paſs the uſual <hi>Curſus</hi> in the Arts and Sciences, which he followed in the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Methods of both <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities: his skill in the copious and elegant Greek with its curious Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſms deſerves a remarkable accent. Among the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Sects of ancient Philoſophers, he was moſt addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to <hi>Plato</hi> and the ſhades of the Academick walks. From the Grecian Schools he ſtept into the Roman Cloiſters to hear what they had to ſay, before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſprang. The Civilians having found the Juſtinian Laws as I remember at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Theodoſian <hi>Codex,</hi> began to digeſt them into ſome Method. The Divines took example, and collected a Body of Sentences. Among whoſe numerous Gladiators, he moſt fancied the fencings of <hi>Aquinas, Bradwardin, Suarez,</hi> and <hi>Alvarez,</hi> being pleaſed with their reaſon, but not their ſubtilties, their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Arguments, but not their Quiddities, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome little Pearls in great Dunghils, was wont to ſay, They had great heads, but little hearts. And indeed when the original Fountains of Scripture were ſtopt up by the Philiſtins, and little but rage and fury filled moſt places with the blood of the ſlain Profeſſors of the Truth, who could expect but the Owl (which once) ſhould often fly in the Lateran?</p>
            <p>Wherefore from the Papal Schools he went beyond
<pb facs="tcp:99997:6"/>Sea, and ſtood under the Fathers Pulpits, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in hearing the African Wits, <hi>Athanaſius, Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Auſtin. Athanaſius</hi> he highly honoured for his notable Writings againſt the Arians, and his ſtrenuous Vindication of the Deity of Chriſt, and the Doctrine of the three Perſons by the holy Scriptures: and was wont to ſay, That he wrote ſo like an Apoſtle, that he was even raviſhed with him. <hi>Cyril</hi> he alſo greatly eſteemed for his Epheſine conflicts on the ſame account. <hi>Auſtin</hi> of the Latin Communion, he paſſed from <hi>Alexandria</hi> to <hi>Hippo,</hi> on purpoſe to ſee and diſcourſe with him becauſe of his ſhining holineſs, and eſpecially his irreſiſtible Defence of irreſiſtible Grace. And indeed I may add, there's no hearty Enemy of free Grace but ſuch as want it, and thoſe that feel its power in the heart, are its greateſt Lovers. His Book of the Trinity, though he judged ſomewhat ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, yet not without ſome light. He had a value alſo for <hi>Baſil</hi> and the two Grecian <hi>Gregories,</hi> and indeed in whom he found <hi>aliquid Chriſti,</hi> ſomething to the honour of Chriſt, he would crown them with praiſes. For Chriſt was the chief ſcope of his medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſtudies, as it is of all faithful Miniſters to turn Souls to him, and enamour them with him, delighting to dig in that Rock of <hi>Zion</hi> more than in a Rock of Diamonds.</p>
            <p>Theſe illuſtrious Truths about the Trinity and the Incarnation of our Lord he ſtiled Stars of the first magnitude, and indeed it may be juſtly added, they are the Sun of the Goſpel heavens, wherein he ſaid, he could meditate night and day: and ſometimes thought he was carried out too long; inſomuch that being in his Country-receſs, and upon the wing, as bath been obſerved, his nobler ſpirits towred up ſo high, as to leave his animal ſpirits bird-limed in a
<pb facs="tcp:99997:6"/>maze below, and having found ſweeter food above the Firmament, did ſoon forget the refreſhment of his deſerted body, drawing nigh the flight of ſome of the Ancients, of whom 'tis ſtoried, they forſook the earth, and found their Souls embalmed in the boſom of eternal Love. The ſweetneſs of theſe dainties nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed his conceptions, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hit right when he placed happineſs in the contemplation of Truth. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs he became through Grace the more humble, verifying the excellency of ſanctified knowledge, that it grows moſt luxuriant in the ſat vallies of humility. It was ſaid of one, That he ſailed ſo long upon the Ocean of Knowledge, that at laſt he was toſſed into the Haven of Ignorance; and when arrived to the knowledge of more than moſt of Mortals, determined to grave upon <hi>Minerva's</hi> Pillars, <hi>Ne plus ultrà,</hi> or, <hi>Nihil ſcitur:</hi> or to uſe Scripture-phraſe, That there is no finding out the Almighty to perfection in any of his ways or works. But our Contemplator, though he found new Regions of Light and Science above the Heavens, was humbled by ſearches, and exalted by humility, and did much condemn ſuch as dared to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any thing of God without book; not only when againſt, but beſides the ſacred Oracles. When any did irrationally and irreverently apply the term of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to an infinite Being, or were ſo bold as to ſtate peremptory Concluſions about the Decrees and Preſcience of God, undertaking to unlade the deep waters above the Heavens with their Brain-ſick pan, he uſed that of <hi>Bradwardin [Si non poſſis minimum, quomodo maximum.]</hi> If no Anatomiſt can unwinde the texture of the Brain of an Ant, or diſcover the wiſdom of that minute Inſect, how much leſs can any wade into, or feel the bottom of thoſe holy, precious, unfathomable depths of the Eternal God, whom the Heaven of heavens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:99997:7"/>contain? Or as that annexed at the bottom of <hi>Bernard [Quomodo te ſi non meipſum.]</hi> The World is not yet come to an iſſue about the humane Soul, and why will they burn their wings at the rays of the inacceſſible Light? He then put his experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſeal to that of the holy Burgundian Abbot <hi>[Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator Majeſtatis opprimetur à gloria.]</hi> He who charges the Seraphims of folly in compariſon with his infinite Wiſdom, might upon their crying, Holy, Holy, Holy, cauſe his <hi>Sinai</hi>-voice to ſound with imputations of grand <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nholineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion to their lips and hearts.</p>
            <p>This holy man found the eye of his Soul more daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by prying into theſe radiant Myſteries, than that of his body by gazing on the fiery Lamp of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Heavens; affirming, that nothing did ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually humble him, no not his ſharpeſt afflictions, nor the bittereſt cups make him ſo ſtagger into the duſt, as ſome glittering reflections of the Divine Majeſty upon his Soul: and cry out with <hi>Agur, I am more brutiſh than any;</hi> or with that other Saint, <hi>I am like a Behemoth, a great beaſt before thee.</hi> But for points revealed in Scripture, he took more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar pains, and ſuckt more ſatisfying delight from the breaſts of the Incarnation. He endeavoured to open that Myſtery of Godlineſs <hi>[God manifeſt in the fleſh]</hi> in ſo plain and familiar a way, as the truth might bear, that weak capacities might gather ſtrength, and thoſe of greater light might find greater afflux of ſpiritual oyl to their Lamps from this Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree in the Courts of God. And I hope the Lord will raiſe up ſome other that hath walked from the Paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garden in <hi>Gethſemane</hi> along with our Thorn-crowned Lord through the dolorous way to the Paſſion-mount of <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and have found the Sympathy, Nails,
<pb facs="tcp:99997:7"/>and Spear in their own hearts, that will lament his ſorrows with ſo bitter a cry, as to pierce the ſouls of many to entertain a bleeding Saviour within the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their hearts. It was his ſaying whoſe Treatiſe follows, He knew no other bottom whereon to lay the ſtreſs of his Salvation, than the Son of God incarnate: most certainly true of all, who ſpend their joys on his Incarnation, and breathe out their believing ſighs upon his Paſſion. So that this having been his great ſtudy, he ſaid a little before his departure: That though moſt were apt to look upon theſe as ſpeculative Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, yet he esteemed them as the most practical, and the very heart and kernel of our Salvation involved in them.</p>
            <p>In the delivery of theſe and other great Doctrines of the Goſpel, that he gave in Precept to his Son, he gave in Preſident to others in imitation of Chriſt, who taught his Diſciples as they were able to bear both as to gradual matter, and as to a pleaſant form in apt ſimilitudes in his occaſional walkings, and constant heavenly teachings. Thus our Author eſteemed that character of an Orator to be no leſs uſeful than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>[To teach, perſwade, and delight]</hi> to teach by cogent Arguments, to perſwade by inſinuating Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and to delight with elegant Metaphors. As the Lord himſelf ſpeaks,
<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 12.10.</note> 
               <hi>I have uſed ſimilitudes by my Servants the Prophets;</hi> and that the wiſe Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ſought <hi>to find out acceptable words</hi> as well as words of truth, ſuch as might be like Apples of gold in Pictures of ſilver, as well as goads and nails faſtned by the Maſters of Aſſemblies: ſuch as may not ſo much pleaſe the ears as prick the heart, as <hi>Jerom</hi> gloſſes, <hi>Non placentia, ſed pungentia;</hi> adding further, <hi>Lachrymae auditorum, &amp;c.</hi> The tears of Auditors are the Pearls of Preachers. Such did our
<pb facs="tcp:99997:8"/>grave Author uſe, not jingling Bells, but deep Peals of repentance; not bald and ſlovenly, but apt and ſignificant terms, that the Lamb might wade, and the Elephant ſwim in the fluency of his expreſſions.</p>
            <p>When near the time of taking his flight to Glory, having been verſed in the Divine Methods of the Holy Spirit in the communications of Grace, and the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inſtillations of it into the ſouls of men, he treated of the Deity of the Spirit, his proceſſion from the Father and the Son, and his powerful operations on the heart, and being raviſhed with the effuſions of the Spirit here, went up to injoy his more plentiful infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the celeſtial Manſions. Being nearer his time of receſs into the Country of <hi>Canaan</hi> above, he dived into the meditation of that Text of <hi>Paul [The time is ſhort]</hi> having prepared ſome heavenly Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the ſhortneſs of time, and the uncertainty of life, concluded thus:
<q>We ſhould not deſire to continue longer in this world, than to glorifie God, and finiſh our given work, and be ready to ſay, Farewel Time, welcome bleſt Eternity: even ſo come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this Evening-Star ſet in an Ocean of Joy, to ariſe a Morning-Star in the Eaſtern Ocean of Glory. But before his diſappearance, the frame of his Spirit being much agitated with ſollicitude about the Church of God, and particularly in this Land and Nation, uttered a Swan-like Song, teſtifying ſomewhat of a prophetick Spirit <hi>[If God begin to deliver his Church in an</hi> October, <hi>remember me]</hi> which how far began to be fulfilled in <hi>October 1678.</hi> the Saints ſurviving may give in evidence, and I humbly pray it may never end, though it may mix with ſome over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowings, till we ſee <hi>Zions</hi> full deliverance paſt.</p>
            <p>Thus much of that holy Soul, I ſhall now conclude
<pb facs="tcp:99997:8"/>with a Direction and a Prayer. A Direction as to the Faith and Holineſs of former Saints and Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of Chriſt, and as to ſuch as ſurvive.</p>
            <p>To ſuch as are gone up to Injoyment, I might apply what's ſaid of <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> that when aſcending to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, left a train of light all the way, like the <hi>Via la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctea,</hi> to illuminate the Followers of Juſtice in the ſame illuſtrious path to Happineſs. Lee's hear the Apoſtle: <hi>Remember them which have the rule over you,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.7.</note> who have ſpoken to you the word of God, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday and to day and for ever.</hi> As to infirmities (for who is without them) imitate the Spirit of God in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who never relates or remembers the infirmities of Saints in the Old. They are at reſt in the boſom of Chriſt, let them be at reſt in your boſom as in a bed of Spices. As 'tis ſaid of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> his name was like precious Oyntment compoſed by the Art of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary.</p>
            <p>For ſuch as ſurvive, learn of the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>To obey them that have the rule over you,
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> and ſubmit your ſelves; for they watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief, for that's unprofitable for you. We beſeech you, brethren,
<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.12.</note> to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admoniſh you, and eſteem them very highly in love for their works ſake, and be at peace among your ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Forget not, that when <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were gone to Heaven from two diſtinct Mountains, God ſet apart <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Eleazar</hi> in two diſtinct Vallies to lead their ſurviving children into the Land of Promiſe: and withal told <hi>Joſhua,
<note place="margin">Joſh. 1.5.</note> There ſhall not any man be able
<pb facs="tcp:99997:9"/>to ſtand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, I will be with thee; I will not fail thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> Nay what's doubly remarkable: <hi>Moſes</hi> could only lead them through the Wilderneſs, but <hi>Joſhua</hi> must bring them into <hi>Canaan.</hi> The Law can only ſchool us to Christ,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> but 'tis our heavenly Jeſus or <hi>Joſhua</hi> that can ſafely bring us to the Eternal rest: and beſides its obſervable, we read of no murmurings under <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thus God provides for his Church. When <hi>Elijah</hi> was rid into Heaven, <hi>Eliſha</hi> must follow in the power and ſpirit of <hi>Elias.</hi> When one ſtream is ſlid and ſhed into the Ocean, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circulates from the ſame Ocean through the bowels of the earth into the ſprings under the mountains, and refreſhes the ſcorched Plains. When one Star ſets, another riſes to guide the wandring traveller, and at length the bright Morning-lamp glitters in the East, and then the glorious Sun of Righteouſneſs. While the Church ſits fainting under a Juniper-tree in the Wilderneſs, there ſhall fly Prophets to feed her till the bleſſed reſurrection of the Witneſſes. It's our high duty to ſtudy preſent work, and prize preſent help, and greatly rejoyce when the Lord ſends forth (as once) both <hi>Boaner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> together. Pray for the mantle, girdle, and bleſſing of <hi>Elijah,</hi> for the love of <hi>John,</hi> and the zeal of <hi>Paul,</hi> to twine hands together to draw Souls to Heaven: till the Beloved comes like a Roe or a young Hart upon the mountains of ſpices: till the ſhadows flee away: till the day dawn, and the Day-star ariſe in your hearts.</p>
            <p>My prayer ſhall end with the ſame Apostle:
<note place="margin">Heb. 13.20.</note> 
               <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepherd of the ſheep through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant, make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight through Jeſus Chriſt, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Myſtery</hi> of Chriſt is the greateſt Myſtery that ever was. There are breadths and lengths, depths and heights in this Myſtery. It is <hi>Calvins</hi> Comment on the Text,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Continet u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Chriſti dilectio om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros.</hi> Calv.</note> 
                     <hi>that</hi> one <hi>love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it all the dimenſions and meaſures of wiſdom.</hi> When the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>breadths, lengths, depths</hi> and <hi>heights,</hi> that which he intends is, that in <hi>one</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>height, breadth, length,</hi> and <hi>depth</hi> of all true wiſdom: <hi>in him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2.3. and <hi>in him are ye compleat.</hi> A Chriſtian needs to ſtudy nothing but <hi>one Chriſt,</hi> there is enough in Chriſt to take up his <hi>ſtudy</hi> and <hi>contemplation</hi> all his days; and the more we ſtudy Chriſt, the more we may ſtudy him. There will be <hi>new wonders</hi> ſtill appearing in Chriſt. The Name of Chriſt is called <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. and indeed well may it be called ſo: every thing in Chriſt is a <hi>wonder,</hi> moſt <hi>wonderful;</hi> his <hi>eternal Generation</hi> from the Father; his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſubſiſtence</hi> in the Godhead; his <hi>taking</hi> our <hi>nature;</hi> the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the two <hi>Natures,</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and the nature of man in that one perſon of Chriſt; his <hi>Paſſion;</hi> his <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into Heaven; his ſitting at the right hand of God in our nature: all theſe are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Now his <hi>love</hi> is the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>foundation</hi> of all, and runs through all whatſoever reſpects us; whatſoever Chriſt <hi>is,</hi> whatſoever Chriſt <hi>doth,</hi> with relation to us, his love is the root of all, and runs through all: his love runs through his <hi>Incarnation, Paſſion, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>ſitting</hi> at the Fathers right hand. It was out of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99997:10"/>love to us he took up our nature, ſubjected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Law, dyed in our nature, roſe again in it, carried our nature into Heaven, and wears it there, and will wear it to all Eternity: I ſay, his love is the root of all this.</p>
                  <p>My deſire is to ſpeak a little of this infinite Love of Chriſt. The Apoſtle intimates in the <hi>Text,</hi> that it is a great duty incumbent on us to take in as much as poſſibly we can of this <hi>infinite</hi> and incomprehenſible love of Chriſt, <hi>That ye may comprehend with all Saints what are the heights,</hi> &amp;c. Here it may be inquired what is this expreſſion added <hi>with all Saints;</hi> I conceive it is to ſhew us two things.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That <hi>Grace</hi> in the hearts of the Saints doth naturally put them upon this <hi>ſtudy.</hi> It is the <hi>natural tendency</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> as they are <hi>Saints,</hi> to ſtudy and take in as much of the love of Chriſt as is poſſible. <hi>That ye may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend with all Saints;</hi> as much as if he ſhould ſay, This is that which all Saints are preſſing after and aſpiring unto, they all deſire to know more and more of the love of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This expreſſion is added to ſhew, that it is the <hi>great</hi> duty of all the Saints to make the <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt their <hi>great ſtudy. That ye may comprehend with all Saints;</hi> as much as if he ſhould ſay, It is your duty, and the duty of all the Saints to ſtudy the dimenſions of Chriſts love. What will Heaven be, but a clear and perfect knowledge of the love of God in Chriſt? Then ſhall we know and underſtand perfectly what the purpoſe of the Father was to communicate himſelf to the Elect by the Son: and ſo ſhall we be <hi>filled</hi> with the <hi>fulneſs</hi> of God, as the expreſſion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99997:11"/>is here in this Text; and elſewhere it is ſaid, <hi>God ſhall be all in all.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.28.</note> Not that we ſhall be able in Heaven it ſelf to <hi>comprehend</hi> and take in the <hi>whole</hi> of this love; for our underſtanding being finite, cannot fully comprehend the infinite love of God: but the ſouls of the Elect ſhall then be brim-full of it; they ſhall take in as much of this love as they are able to contain. Now there is ſomething of this love may be underſtood and taken in here on earth; for the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of ſomething that may be taken in here on earth, when he ſaith, that <hi>you may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the height and depth, and breadth and length of the love of Chriſt:</hi> as much as if he ſhould ſay, This is that knowledge that the Saints ought to be preſſing after here on earth, all Saints ought to aim and level at this mark. The more we know and underſtand of this love of Chriſt, the more will our hearts be raviſhed with it, and the more ſhall we be over-powered and ſwallowed up in the admiration of it; for <hi>we love him becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Amor eſt qui amatur.</note> It is <hi>love</hi> it ſelf that is that which we <hi>love:</hi> it is Gods love to us, made known to us in and by his Son that muſt draw our hearts to <hi>love</hi> him. The great end why God chuſeth his people is, that <hi>they ſhould be holy and unblameable before him in love, Eph.</hi> 1.4. Now this being the great end of God to bring us to love him, the more we come to know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his infinite love to us, the more will our love be perfected towards him.</p>
                  <p>There are two things that lye in the words of the Text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here is a <hi>Suppoſition.</hi> The <hi>Suppoſition</hi> is, that the <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt is exceeding great, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99997:11"/>carries all dimenſions in it. <hi>That ye may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what is the height and the depth, and the breadth and length of the love of Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtle ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this, that there are heights, and depths, and breadths, and lengths in the love of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We have in the Text the Apoſtles <hi>prayer</hi> for the Saints upon this <hi>ſuppoſition;</hi> and that is, that the love of Chriſt being ſo great, they may <hi>know, underſtand,</hi> and <hi>comprehend</hi> it more and more.</p>
                  <p>There are two Obſervations or Doctrines that do naturally ariſe from the words of the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> That the <hi>Love of Chriſt is infinite</hi> and <hi>ſurpaſſing great,</hi> and <hi>ſuch a love</hi> as <hi>carries all manner of dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in it;</hi> there are <hi>heights,</hi> and <hi>depths,</hi> and <hi>breadths,</hi> and <hi>lengths</hi> in Chriſts <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label> That it <hi>ought to be the endeavour of all the Saints to know, underſtand, comprehend and take in more and more of this infinite and ſurpaſſing love of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin to ſpeak to the firſt Obſervation, which is,</p>
                  <p>That the Love of Chriſt is <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>ſurpaſſing great,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label> and <hi>ſuch a love as carries all manner of dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in it;</hi> there are heights and depths, breadths and lengths in the Love of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Here there are two things I ſhall treat of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Shew what the Love of Chriſt is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Shew how the greatneſs, infiniteneſs, and ſurpaſſingneſs of this Love may be a little deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and ſet forth to us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt open the Nature of Chriſts Love in the general.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand this there is a threefold Love we may diſtinguiſh of. 1. There is a love of <hi>Benevolence</hi> or <hi>good-will.</hi> 2. There is the love of <hi>Beneficence.</hi> 3. There is the love of <hi>Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:99997:12"/>
                  <p n="1">1. There is the love of <hi>Benevolence</hi> or <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> and this is nothing elſe but an <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, purpoſe,</hi> or <hi>decree</hi> of doing good to another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the love of <hi>Beneficence,</hi> and this is that love whereby a man doth not only will good to another, but doth actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confer and beſtow ſome good upon him: and this is not ſo properly love, as the effect of love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is the love of <hi>Complacency,</hi> and that is, when a man takes delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in that good which is in another.</p>
                  <p>According to this threefold <hi>diſtinction</hi> we may a little conceive of the Love of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is the love of <hi>Benevolence</hi> or <hi>good-will</hi> in Chriſt. This is ſuch a love whereby a man <hi>wills</hi> good to another, <hi>purpoſes</hi> and <hi>intends</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow <hi>good</hi> upon him. This love was in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Chriſt had a purpoſe and intention from Eternity to beſtow grace and glory upon his people. To underſtand which, we muſt know, that <hi>all the works of the Trinity which do reſpect the creature, are undivided.</hi> What the Father doth, the Son doth, and the Spirit doth: what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſeth, the Son purpoſeth, and the Spirit purpoſeth. It is true, <hi>Election</hi> is in a peculiar manner attributed to the Father: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, according as he hath choſen us in him.</hi> Here we ſee <hi>Election</hi> is in a peculiar manner attributed to the Father: but when Election is attributed to the Father, the Son and the Spirit are not to be excluded from <hi>electing:</hi> for Election being an act of Gods will, there is but one and the ſame
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99997:12"/>
                     <hi>eſſential will</hi> in <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> what the Father wills, the Son muſt needs will, and the Spirit wills alſo: and the reaſon is, As there is but one and the ſame Eſſence, ſo but one and the ſame Will in the three perſons. Therefore the Father willing to beſtow grace and glory upon ſuch a number of men, the Son muſt needs will it too: Therefore Chriſt ſaith, <hi>All thine are mine, and mine are thine, Joh.</hi> 17.10. All the <hi>Elect</hi> are common to the Father and the Son: they are both the Father's, and Chriſt's. As the Father hath choſen them, ſo the Son hath choſen them: and as the Father is glorified in their ſalvation, ſo is the Son: therefore are the Elect ſaid to be <hi>Chriſts own, Joh.</hi> 13.1.— and they are called <hi>his ſheep,</hi> and theſe ſheep he knows, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.14.— How doth he know his ſheep? he knows them from Eternity, and loves them from Eternity. So that there is the love of <hi>Benevolence</hi> or <hi>good-will</hi> in Chriſt. Therefore he ſaith in <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. <hi>I give unto them eternal life.</hi> It is in the <hi>preſent Tenſe,
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> I do give unto them eternal life.</hi> How can Chriſt be ſaid to give to his ſheep eternal life? they are not as yet perfectly and compleatly poſſeſſed of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life: The meaning is, Chriſt from Eternity hath decreed to beſtow eternal life upon them, he gives them the beginnings of it in this world in their Juſtification and Sanctification; and they ſhall as certainly have the complement and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it in Glorification at laſt, as if they had it already.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the Love of <hi>Beneficence</hi> in Chriſt. Chriſt doth not only <hi>will</hi> good to his people, but he <hi>beſtows</hi> good upon his people. As he did from Eternity intend to beſtow grace and glory upon
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99997:13"/>them, ſo he doth in time <hi>actually conſer grace</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> upon them. This is expreſt by the Apoſtle to the full, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; whom he called, them he alſo juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> The <hi>creatures</hi> love is oftentimes a <hi>barren</hi> love; men may <hi>wiſh</hi> well to others, they may have a purpoſe and deſire to do good to them, but oſtentimes they want that power and ability to do the good they would: but Chriſts love is a <hi>fruitful</hi> love, he actually beſtows that good upon his people he intends. <hi>Vocation, Juſtification, Sanctification, Glorification</hi> are all the fruits of this eternal Love of his. Chriſts <hi>Love</hi> is ſuch a <hi>love</hi> as brings all manner of <hi>ſpiritual bleſſings</hi> along with it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. not only <hi>Election,</hi> which is the Decree of God to beſtow good things upon us, but alſo <hi>Adoption,</hi> the <hi>forgiveneſs</hi> of ſin, the <hi>acceptation</hi> of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: all which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of in the ſame place, and theſe things are actually conferred on Believers, and they are brought into the poſſeſſion of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is the love of <hi>Complacency</hi> in Chriſt, which is that love whereby he takes delight in the <hi>perſons</hi> and <hi>graces</hi> of his Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt takes delight in the <hi>perſons</hi> of his Saints: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.2. <hi>I have called thee by name, thou art mine.</hi> The Lord tells <hi>Moſes, Thou haſt found grace in my ſight, and I know thee by name,</hi> Exod. 34.17. What is it for God to know <hi>Moſes</hi> by name? It was to take <hi>ſpecial delight</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> to know him, ſo as he did not know other men, to take that delight in him, which he did not in other men. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.4. <hi>Since thou haſt been precious in my ſight, thou haſt been honourable.</hi> Zeph. 3.17. <hi>The Lord
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99997:13"/>thy God will rejoyce over thee with ſinging, he will reſt in his love.</hi> Iſa. 62.5. <hi>As the bridegroom rejoyceth over his bride, ſo ſhall thy God rejoyce over thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt takes delight in the <hi>graces</hi> of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He firſt <hi>beſtows grace</hi> upon his people, and then he delights in his <hi>own</hi> graces: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.11. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in them that fear him.</hi> Prov. 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me.</hi> God is <hi>Love,</hi> and he loves the love of his people: <hi>If any man love me, he ſhall be beloved of me, and I will manifeſt my ſelf to him, Joh.</hi> 14.21. Thus we have ſeen what the nature of Chriſts love is in general.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the ſecond particular, and that is to ſpeak of the dimenſions of Chriſts love. The love of Chriſt is ſuch a love as hath <hi>breadths</hi> and <hi>lengths, heights</hi> and <hi>depths</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p>What are theſe dimenſions of Chriſts love?</p>
                  <p>We are now lanching into the <hi>vaſt Ocean:</hi> the love of Chriſt is ſuch an Ocean as hath no bounds nor bottom in it. We may as ſoon think to comprehend the Ocean in the hollow of our hands, as comprehend his love: the Apoſtle tells us it <hi>paſſeth knowledge;</hi> and if ſo, then it is in vain for us to think to comprehend it: but though we cannot comprehend it, yet there is ſomething we may know of it, otherwiſe the Apoſtle would not have prayed as he doth in the <hi>Text,</hi> that <hi>ye may comprehend with all Saints what are the heights,</hi> &amp;c. We may gather in ſome drops of the Ocean, though we may not think to drain the Ocean; and all that we can hope for is to make known ſome drops of the infinite love of Chriſt. And that we may be able a little to conceive of it, we ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the love of Chriſt theſe three ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the properties of it.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:99997:14"/>
                  <p n="2">2. As it is to be found in both his <hi>Natures,</hi> the love that is in his <hi>humane,</hi> and that is in his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the effects of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The love of Chriſt will appear to be a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing love, to have all manner of dimenſions in it, if we conſider the <hi>properties</hi> of Chriſts Love.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſts love is an <hi>ancient love:</hi> Chriſts love is more <hi>ancient</hi> and of <hi>longer ſtanding</hi> than the world: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world.</hi> The effects of Chriſts love are ſeen in <hi>time,</hi> but the love it ſelf was <hi>before</hi> all time. Gods love to his people is as ancient as his love to himſelf: Gods love to himſelf is from Eternity, and his love to us is from Eternity; therefore doth he ſay, <hi>I have loved thee with an ever laſting love, Jer.</hi> 31.3. It is a ſaying of one of the <hi>Ancients,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mirus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecto amor hominum u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nà cum Deo aeternus.</hi> Cyril.</note> Wonderful indeed is the love of God to man, which is, together with God, eternal,</hi> that is, eternal as God is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Where can we place the beginning of this love? The Scripture teacheth us expreſly, that it was before the foundation of the world, and therefore conſequently before all time: and if before all time, then it muſt needs be from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Chriſt loved us before we had a <hi>being,</hi> yea, it was his love that firſt of all gave us a being, and he therefore gave us a <hi>being,</hi> that he might demonſtrate and ſet forth the riches of that grace and love he had in his heart towards us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.23. <hi>That he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had before prepared unto glory.</hi> The Lord had <hi>prepared glory</hi> in his <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>purpoſe</hi> for the <hi>veſſels of mercy</hi> from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99997:14"/>Eternity, and he therefore gave them <hi>being,</hi> that he might beſtow that glory on them, which he had prepared for them from Eternity. Chriſts <hi>delights</hi> were with the <hi>ſons of men</hi> from Eternity, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.31. Chriſts delight from Eternity was to think what he ſhould do for us, before ever we had a being; even then, when he was the object of the Fathers delight; as it is in the verſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceding, <hi>I was daily his delight.</hi> Even then, when the <hi>eternal Son who lay in the boſom of the eternal Father,</hi> was the <hi>Fathers delight,</hi> yet, if we may ſo ſpeak, he had another delight that took him up, and that was to think what he ſhould do for us. It is the property of love not to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in its own happineſs only, but have deſires of the happineſs of the perſon whom it loves. Chriſt was <hi>infinitely happy</hi> in the Fathers <hi>boſom</hi> in being his <hi>delight,</hi> but he loved us, and therefore was not ſatisfied with his own happineſs, but pleaſed himſelf with the thoughts of making us happy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſts love is a <hi>free love.</hi> The freeneſs of Chriſts love appears in three reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſts love is <hi>free,</hi> becauſe it was not <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:</hi> Chriſt was not drawn from any <hi>neceſſity</hi> of nature to love us, as if he could not chuſe but love us: he might have choſen whether he would have loved us. God indeed loves himſelf <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily:</hi> he loves himſelf, and cannot but love himſelf; but God loves the creature <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>arbitrarily,</hi> he might have choſen whether he would have ſet his love upon it yea or no: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15. <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy.</hi> Gods will is the reaſon of his own love to the creature. God was under no conſtraint to ſhew mercy; but he therefore ſhews mercy, becauſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99997:15"/>mercy pleaſes him; <hi>he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> Gods goodneſs and perfections were ſufficient for himſelf; and if he had needed any thing, the creature could have given him nothing, for the creature had nothing to give him but what God had firſt given to it: and therefore Gods love was moſt free. God was not neceſſitated to have made the creature, or to have given it a being, much leſs was he neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have given it ſuch a ſupernatural good as grace and glory was. God might have made man, and never ordained him to the glory of Heaven; he was not neceſſitated to make man at all, to give him ſo much as a natural being, much leſs was he neceſſitated to give the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and glory of Heaven to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſts love is <hi>free,</hi> for as much as there is no <hi>advantage</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> that comes to him by loving us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.35. <hi>Who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be given to him again?</hi> God did not ſtand in need of any thing out of himſelf, he had <hi>alſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> in himſelf, within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of his own eſſence, if we may ſo ſpeak; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is in the creature, is firſt in God after an eminent manner before it is in the creature. There is nothing in the effect but is firſt in the cauſe: therefore the <hi>Ancients</hi> have this obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, All created things are more perfectly in God than they are in themſelves, even as ſilver is more perfect in gold than in it ſelf. That virtue whereby the creatures were produced, was firſt in God as the cauſe, before it was drawn forth in the creature as the effect: and therefore it is well obſerved by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> God had a purpoſe from Eternity to make the creatures, but he therefore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99997:15"/>made them in time, that he might ſhew he did not ſtand in need of the creatures, but had been perfect and happy without them from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſts love is <hi>free,</hi> for as much as it was without reſpect of merit in us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11, 13. <hi>The children being yet unborn, neither having done good or evil, it was ſaid, Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated.</hi> 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us and called us, not according to our works,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 8.28. <hi>All things work together for good to them who love God, to them who are the called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his purpoſe.</hi> It is true, the Elect do love God, yea but they are firſt <hi>called,</hi> firſt <hi>loved</hi> of God. It was not our <hi>love</hi> to God was the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Gods <hi>love</hi> to us, but Gods <hi>love</hi> to us is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our love to him. God firſt elects, and then calls us, and then we love him. God <hi>decrees</hi> to <hi>give</hi> to the Elect both <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>obedience, Tit.</hi> 1.1.1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. therefore his love cannot poſſibly be grounded upon the <hi>foreſight</hi> of our faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, but is every way moſt free. Sweet are the expreſſions which <hi>Bernard</hi> hath:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amat Deus, nec aliunde hoc habet, ſed ipſe eſt unde amat; &amp; ideò ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementiùs, quia non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merem tam habet, quàm hoc ipſe eſt.</hi> Bern.</note> 
                     <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>loves, neither hath he his love from any thing out of himſelf, but himſelf is the cauſe of his own love: and therefore his love is most ſtrong, becauſe he is not ſo properly ſaid to have love, as himſelf is love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>ſpecial peculiar</hi> love. There is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon general</hi> love which God bears to all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but there is a <hi>ſpecial peculiar</hi> love which God bears to his people. God loveth all his creatures with a general love; but it is ſome only he loves with a ſpecial and peculiar love.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99997:16"/>God,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Omnes qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, ſed non ad aequale honum.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</note> as one obſerves, loves all his creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but he doth not love them ſo as to will the <hi>ſame</hi> good, or to beſtow the ſame equal good upon them all. God is <hi>good</hi> to all, and his tender <hi>mercies are over all his works.</hi> He <hi>feeds</hi> the <hi>ravens, cloaths</hi> the <hi>lilies,</hi> gives <hi>life, breath, being</hi> to all creatures; but then there is a ſpecial love which he bears to his people. Firſt, he gives <hi>himſelf</hi> to them: <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>This is the covenant I will make with them, I will be their God.</hi> Secondly, he gives them his Son: <hi>Having given us his Son, Rom.</hi> 8.32. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. Thirdly, he gives <hi>Heaven, Salvation,</hi> and <hi>eternal life</hi> unto them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.32. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. Theſe are the things that God beſtows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his people: ſo then it is a ſpecial love in this reſpect. God beſtows <hi>common</hi> bleſſings upon others; he beſtows many temporal bleſſings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men; but his ſpecial favours are reſerved for the Elect: therefore he is ſaid to be the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. God preſerves and ſaves all men by a common Providence, but he is in a ſpecial peculiar manner the <hi>Saviour</hi> of Believers: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called <hi>the Saviour of the body, Eph.</hi> 5.23. Compare theſe Scriptures together; in one place he is ſaid to be the Saviour of <hi>all men,</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place he is ſaid to be the <hi>Saviour</hi> of his <hi>body the Church.</hi> Chriſt is the Saviour of all men in ſome reſpect, but not ſo as he is the <hi>Saviour</hi> of his <hi>body the Church:</hi> he ſaves all men with a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſalvation,</hi> but he doth not ſave all men with a <hi>ſpiritual eternal</hi> ſalvation, it is the Church only he ſo ſaves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The love of Chriſt is a <hi>diſcriminating</hi> love, becauſe it is ſuch a love as is beſtowed upon <hi>ſome</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99997:16"/>perſons which is not beſtowed upon <hi>others: Whom he foreknew, them he did predeſtinate, Rom.</hi> 8.29. How did he <hi>foreknow</hi> them? he <hi>foreknew</hi> them ſo as to <hi>love</hi> them. He knows all his creatures from Eternity, but he doth not ſo foreknow all as to love all alike: but he foreknows ſome after a ſpecial manner, he ſo <hi>foreknows ſome</hi> as he doth not <hi>foreknow others:</hi> he ſo foreknows ſome from Eternity as to love them from Eternity: he ſo <hi>foreknows</hi> ſome as to <hi>paſs</hi> by others: hence it is ſaid, he <hi>loved his own which were in the world,</hi> Joh. 13.1. he <hi>hath choſen them out of the world,</hi> Joh. 15.19. and he <hi>prays for them, not for the world,</hi> Joh. 17.9. Here we may cry out with the <hi>Apoſtle, O the depths!</hi> There was no reaſon on the part of the <hi>Elect</hi> why they ſhould be choſen, and not others, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Was not Eſau Jacobs brother, ſaith the Lord? yet I loved Jacob.</hi> As much as if it had been ſaid, What <hi>preheminence</hi> had <hi>Jacob</hi> more than <hi>Eſau,</hi> when I made my Election? Was not <hi>Eſau Jacobs</hi> brother? Did not <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſtand upon <hi>equal ground?</hi> and might I not have taken one as well as another? Nay <hi>Eſau</hi> was the <hi>elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Jacob have I loved.</hi> There is no dignity or worth in the Elect why they ſhould be choſen more than others: the Elect themſelves were involved in the ſame common condition of ſin and miſery with others: but <hi>God who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he hath loved us, Eph.</hi> 2.4. hath beſtowed that love on ſome which he hath denied to others. The reaſon of this love is not from any thing on the Elects part, but from Gods own <hi>Soveraign will; he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy.</hi> Thoſe who are choſen are not better and more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99997:17"/>worthy than others, but God out of his own love will make them to be <hi>veſſels of mercy</hi> when as he will paſs by others.</p>

                        <p>May be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height:</p>

                  <p>WE have already heard three <hi>Properties</hi> of Chriſts love, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is <hi>ancient, free, peculiar.</hi> The fourth <hi>Property</hi> of Chriſts love is, that it is an <hi>intenſe</hi> and a <hi>ſtrong</hi> love. He is ſaid to have the greateſt and ſtrongeſt love to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that <hi>intends</hi> moſt <hi>good</hi> to another, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be at the greateſt <hi>coſt</hi> and <hi>charges</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that good for him. If a father intend to ſettle ſuch an inheritance upon his child, and will lay out all the money he hath to purchaſe that inheritance, it is a ſign he loves that child well. So is it in this caſe: the things that God intends to beſtow upon his people are the greateſt things, and he hath been at the greateſt coſt and charges to bring them to this inheritance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God beſtows upon his people the <hi>greateſt things,</hi> and therein he ſhews how ſtrong his love is to them. What things are they? no leſs than <hi>himſelf,</hi> his own <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>bleſſedneſs,</hi> all the <hi>riches</hi> of <hi>Heaven; Heirs of God, coheirs with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>Heirs of God,</hi> what is that? We ſhall <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit</hi>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:99997:18"/>God himſelf for our <hi>portion,</hi> we ſhall enjoy all that he is, all that God hath, ſo far as we are capable, or according to the <hi>meaſure</hi> and <hi>capavity</hi> of creatures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the things are great in themſelves which God beſtows upon his people, ſo God hath been at great <hi>charge</hi> and <hi>expences</hi> to bring us to this inheritance. He hath given us his <hi>Son,</hi> his <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> his <hi>Promiſes,</hi> his <hi>Providences,</hi> his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> to bring us to this inheritance. <hi>All things work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8.28. Obſerve the laſt expreſſion, <hi>the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> Thoſe whom God hath a purpoſe to ſave, thoſe whom he hath laid out his eternal love upon, all things are ordered to bring them to that happineſs he hath purpoſed to beſtow upon them. God lays the train of all his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences ſo as to bring his Elect to that happineſs he hath choſen them to.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The love of Chriſt is <hi>conſtant, unchangeable,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting.</hi> The unchangeableneſs of Gods love ariſeth from the unchangeableneſs of his nature: <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.6. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not, therefore the ſons of Jacob are not conſumed.</hi> As much as if God ſhould have ſaid, My nature is unchangeable, and that is the reaſon my love and mercy towards you is never changed. The manifeſtation of Gods love may be changed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; we may not apprehend the ſame effects of love at one time as at another; therefore doth the Church complain, <hi>Lam.</hi> 5. <hi>ult. Thou haſt ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly rejected us, thou art very wroth againſt us:</hi> but yet the <hi>root</hi> and <hi>fountain</hi> of Gods love is ſtill the ſame. <hi>Whom the Lord loves he rebukes and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99997:19"/>chaſtens, Rev.</hi> 3.20. Gods correction of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple proceeds from his love. Not but that God is truly diſpleaſed with the ſins of his people: when his people give way to ſuch particular ſins, he diſapproves of ſuch particular acts of theirs, and diſapproves of them in relation to thoſe acts; therefore when <hi>David</hi> committed that ſin in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah's</hi> wife, the Text ſaith expreſly, but <hi>the thing which David did, diſpleaſed the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> It is contrary to the nature of God, who is Holineſs it ſelf, to approve of the ſins of his people, or of them with relation to ſuch ſinful acts: nay God may be ſo far angry for particular miſcarriages in his people, as to take up the <hi>rod</hi> and correct them; yet in this very caſe Gods <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal love</hi> remains. The Scripture is very clear to this purpoſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.30, 31. <hi>If his children forſake my law, &amp;c. then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rood, &amp;c nevertheleſs my loving-kindneſs will I not utterly take from him.</hi> Here we ſee Gods <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſpleaſure</hi> or his <hi>fatherly corrections</hi> may conſiſt with his love: yea in ſome ſenſe Gods corrections are the Fruit of his love. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>We are chaſtened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world;</hi> he therefore <hi>chaſtens,</hi> that he may not <hi>condemn.</hi> Gods love to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is a <hi>fixed, unalterable</hi> thing. Gods love is founded in his eternal purpoſe: now there is no changing of Gods purpoſe. It is a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11. <hi>That the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand.</hi> The purpoſe of God in election <hi>ſtands firm,</hi> and this is matter of ſingular and unſpeakable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to the Saints of God. If thou canſt once ſee a line of electing love drawn forth upon thee,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99997:19"/>thou mayſt conclude the purpoſe of God remains unalterable concerning thee. Now it is poſſible a Saint may know his election, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Knowing, beloved, your election of God.</hi> A Saint may know his <hi>Election</hi> by his <hi>Vocation,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Give diligence to make your calling and election ſure.</hi> Now if thou canſt find out thy election, thou mayſt conclude the purpoſe of God ſtands unalterable to thee. Chriſts love is from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and his love never ends. <hi>Having loved his own, he loved them to the end, Joh.</hi> 13.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Having ſpoken of the <hi>Properties</hi> of Chriſts love, I come to ſpeak of the love that is to be found in both his <hi>Natures,</hi> in the <hi>Divine</hi> and in the <hi>humane</hi> nature.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt is a <hi>great love,</hi> if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the love that is to be found in each of his <hi>Natures,</hi> the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>humane nature. Eph.</hi> 5.25. it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt hath loved the Church, and given himſelf for it.</hi> Chriſt, as <hi>God,</hi> hath loved the <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Eternity;</hi> therefore is it ſaid, <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, Jer.</hi> 31.3. Now to this <hi>ancient</hi> and <hi>first</hi> love of his there was a <hi>new love</hi> added, and that was the love of Chriſt as <hi>Man:</hi> this love which is founded in his humane nature had a <hi>beginning,</hi> even as the humanity it ſelf had a beginning: but yet it is ſuch a <hi>love</hi> as never ſhall have an end. Chriſt therefore loves his Church with a <hi>twofold love,</hi> with a <hi>Divine</hi> and a <hi>humane love,</hi> each of which is the moſt <hi>ſincere,</hi> the <hi>greateſt,</hi> the moſt <hi>perfect,</hi> the moſt <hi>conſtant,</hi> and <hi>abiding</hi> love. I ſhall ſpeak</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of the love that is in his <hi>humane nature,</hi> becauſe that will help us to conceive the better of the love that is in his <hi>Divine nature:</hi> the love
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99997:20"/>that is in the <hi>humane nature</hi> is the <hi>product</hi> or <hi>effect</hi> of the love that is in his <hi>Divine nature:</hi> and if the love of his humane nature be ſo great, the love of his Divine nature muſt needs be far greater, as we ſhall hear.</p>
                  <p>The love which is in his <hi>humane nature</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great. To underſtand which, we muſt conſider, as there are two <hi>natures</hi> in Chriſt, the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>humane nature;</hi> ſo there are two <hi>wills,</hi> the <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>humane</hi> will: and as there are two <hi>wills</hi> in Chriſt, ſo we muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe a twofold <hi>operation</hi> of thoſe wills, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence a twofold <hi>love</hi> in Chriſt; for love is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the <hi>efflux</hi> of the will, ſome <hi>motion</hi> in the will whereby ſome good is willed to another: now the love that is in Chriſts <hi>humane nature</hi> is exceeding great. It is true, that which the <hi>School men</hi> call <hi>Habitual</hi> grace, which is in the ſoul of Chriſt, is not <hi>ſimply infinite,</hi> and the reaſon that they give is this: The <hi>humane ſoul</hi> of Chriſt being but a <hi>creature,</hi> and not infinite, the <hi>habits</hi> of grace which do <hi>inhere</hi> in his humane ſoul, as the <hi>ſubject,</hi> they themſelves cannot be ſuppoſed to be infinite; for the <hi>habits</hi> cannot exceed the capacity of the ſubject: if the humane ſoul of Chriſt be but a <hi>created thing,</hi> then the <hi>habits</hi> of grace which are in it, are not ſimply infinite; yet notwithſtanding this, the love which is to be found in Chriſts humane nature, is exceeding great, and a love ſurpaſſing the love of men or Angels: and the reaſon is, the <hi>humane</hi> ſoul of Chriſt hath the <hi>Divinity</hi> inhabiting in it: now as the Son receives all the Father hath in the <hi>eternal Generation,</hi> (the whole ſubſtance of the Father is communicated to the Son in the <hi>eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:99997:20"/>there is no perfection that is in the Father but it is to be found in the Son) therefore by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it follows, that the <hi>love</hi> of the Father muſt neceſſarily be communicated to the Son, and doth reſide in the Son, and there is but one and the ſame <hi>Divine love</hi> both in the Father and in the Son. Now the Son, the ſecond perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, taking our nature, both the love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son (for, as an Holy man obſerves, <hi>Sweet is this contemplation</hi>) doth in ſome ſort <hi>abide</hi> and <hi>reſide</hi> in our nature; therefore the <hi>humane Soul</hi> of Chriſt being <hi>inflamed</hi> and ſet on fire with the fire of <hi>Divine love</hi> (which is ſo <hi>near</hi> it, which <hi>inhabits</hi> and <hi>dwells</hi> in it) muſt needs be fuller of love than any creatures heart ever was. The humane nature of Chriſt by means of its Union and Conjunction with the Divinity, takes in the influence of the Divinity; and the Divinity thus perſonally united to the Humanity, muſt needs fill his ſoul with that love that no creature was ever filled with: therefore we muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe there was the greateſt love <hi>imaginable</hi> in Chriſts humane ſoul, the greateſt as was <hi>poſſible</hi> there could be in any created nature. <hi>The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwelling in Chriſt bodily,</hi> that infinite love of God muſt be ſuppoſed in ſome ſenſe to dwell in the heart of Chriſt Man. How loving, how ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how affectionate muſt that heart be that hath all the love of the Father and the Son pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out into it? For conſider it, the <hi>Son</hi> receives all from the <hi>Father</hi> by <hi>eternal Generation,</hi> the Son takes up our nature and dwells in it; the humane nature united to the Son, takes in the influence of the Fathers and the Sons love by means of its perſonal Union with the Son. And thus the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99997:21"/>nature is not only <hi>warmed,</hi> but wholly ſet on fire by the <hi>Divinity</hi> inhabiting in it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is well obſerved by one of the Ancients, <hi>There is ſome warmth, ſome heat that comes from Chriſt the eternal Word into all the Saints hearts;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>In hac ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ipſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis divinus ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter requie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendus eſt.</hi> Orig.</note> but in Chriſts humane Soul the very fire of Divine love dwells ſubſtantially:</hi> there it reſted ſubſtantially; for <hi>in him the fulneſs of the Goahead dwells bodily, Col.</hi> 2.9. Therefore there is the greateſt love ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable to be found even in the <hi>humane Soul</hi> of Chriſt. More particularly the love that was in the humane Soul of Jeſus Chriſt may be deſcribed and ſet forth under three conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The heart of Chriſt-Man was filled with the moſt <hi>ſweet, tender, merciful, compaſſionate</hi> diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ever any heart was filled with. Hence is it, that we have thoſe expreſſions, that he is a <hi>merciful</hi> and a <hi>faithful</hi> High Prieſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. that <hi>he is touched with the feeling of our infirmities, Heb.</hi> 3.15. We read alſo of the <hi>bowels</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>meekneſs,</hi> the <hi>gentleneſs</hi> of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1. Never were there ſuch <hi>words</hi> of <hi>love</hi> and <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> ſpoken by any man as by him: never was there ſuch a <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> heart as the heart-of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Grace was poured into his lips, Pſal.</hi> 45.3. Certainly never were there ſuch words of love, ſweetneſs, and tenderneſs ſpoken here upon this earth as thoſe laſt words of his which were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a little before his Suffering, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp; 17 Chapters of <hi>John.</hi> Read over all the Books of love and friendſhip that were ever written by any of the ſons of men, they do all come far ſhort of thoſe melting ſtrains of love that are there expreſſed. So ſweet and amiable was the converſation of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99997:21"/>Jeſus Chriſt, that it is reported of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> that after Chriſts <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> he wept ſo abundantly, that he
<note place="margin">Quoties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordaretur illius ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſſimae converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti.</note> was always ſeen wiping his face from the tears; and being asked why he wept ſo, he anſwered, He could not chuſe but weep as often as he thought of that moſt ſweet converſation of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The love of Chriſt as <hi>Man,</hi> or which was in his <hi>humane nature,</hi> may be ſeen in the <hi>compliance</hi> of his <hi>humane</hi> will with the <hi>Divine</hi> will in point of ſuffering. It is true, it was the Divine will that gave up the humane nature to ſuffer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. <hi>The bread which I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> It was the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will that gave up the humanity to ſuffer, yet his <hi>humane</hi> will complied with the <hi>Divine</hi> will: <hi>Father, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> There is a <hi>will</hi> and a will in Chriſt, a <hi>Divine</hi> will and a <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> will, and the <hi>humane</hi> will <hi>complies</hi> with the Divine will. <hi>Father, ſave me from this hour, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs for this cauſe came I to this hour, Joh.</hi> 12.27. Hence is it, that the Apoſtle tells us he was <hi>obedient unto the death, Phil.</hi> 2.8. The Lord Jeſus knew right-well how great a burden the weight and preſſure of his Fathers wrath was, and yet he was content to undergo this burden for our ſakes. <hi>The cup which my Father hath given me to drink, ſhall not I drink of it?</hi> Joh. 18.11. <hi>I have a baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed,</hi> Luk. 12.50. It is true, had he not been God, he could never have ſtood under ſuch a burden as the burden of Divine wrath: and had not his love been more than a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted love, had his love been the love of a meer
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:99997:22"/>creature, he would never have undertaken ſuch a work. But being <hi>ſupported</hi> by the <hi>Godhead,</hi> he was <hi>inabled</hi> to undergo his Sufferings, and alſo his humane will influenced by the Deity, was made willing to ſuffer: therefore it is ſaid, <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, Joh.</hi> 17.19. There was a concurrence of his Divine and humane will in his ſuffering: the Divine will in the perſon of the Son ſanctifies and ſets apart the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſuffer; the humane will concurs with the Divine, and is made willing to ſuffer, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life.</hi> The <hi>perſon</hi> that <hi>lays</hi> down his life is the <hi>Son</hi> of God <hi>incarnate,</hi> the <hi>life</hi> which he lays down is the <hi>life</hi> of his <hi>Humanity;</hi> for the <hi>life</hi> of his <hi>Divinity</hi> could never be laid down. Now the <hi>Divine perſon</hi> had the <hi>humane</hi> ſoul and body united to himſelf in the <hi>bond</hi> of <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> The Divine perſon gives up the <hi>humane ſoul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> to be ſeparated from each other at his death, and yet holds them both to himſelf in the bond of perſonal Union. Divines uſe an <hi>apt ſimilitude</hi> to illuſtrate this by: It is as if a man held a ſword in his hand ſheathed, and ſhould draw forth the ſword out of the ſheath: the ſword and ſheath are ſeparated one from the other, yet the <hi>hand</hi> holds both. Here then is the <hi>acting</hi> of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> will, the <hi>Divine</hi> will in the perſon of the Son gives up the humane nature to ſuffer; this is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated in thoſe expreſſions, <hi>No man taketh away my life from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf; I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up again.</hi> Now the <hi>humane will</hi> knowing that it is the pleaſure of the <hi>Divine</hi> will that the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould be given up to ſuffer, <hi>ſubmits</hi> unto,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99997:22"/>and <hi>complies</hi> with the Divine will: this is implied in that expreſſion, <hi>This commandment have I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of my Father, Joh.</hi> 10.18. The <hi>Divine</hi> will of the <hi>Father</hi> and of the <hi>Son</hi> are all one. Now the humane will knowing that it was the pleaſure of the Divine will, that the humane nature ſhould be given up to ſuffering and death, complies with the Divine will herein.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third conſideration to ſet forth the love of Chriſt, as he is Man, or in his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is this: The love of Chriſt, as he is <hi>Man,</hi> may be ſeen in the <hi>Petitions</hi> he offered up to the Father for us whilſt he was here on earth. Much of that love which dwelt in his <hi>humane</hi> ſoul may be ſeen by the prayers and petitions he offered up to the Father for us. It is true, Chriſts <hi>Interceſſion</hi> is a work that belongs to him as <hi>Mediator:</hi> now Chriſt is Mediator not according to one nature only, but according to both natures; and there is a communion of both natures in this action of his praying for us, as well as in the reſt of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatory actions:</hi> but yet although the perſon praying for us be God-man (that very perſon who ſubſiſts in both natures) yet that nature in which he is moſt properly ſaid to pray, is his humane nature: as in his ſufferings, the perſon ſuffering is <hi>God-man,</hi> yet the nature according to which he is ſaid to ſuffer, is the humane nature; therefore he is ſaid to be <hi>put to death in the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. So in his <hi>praying</hi> for us, the <hi>perſon praying</hi> is God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but the nature in which he prays, is the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane: the <hi>whole action</hi> proceeds from the perſon, but the <hi>proximate</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> principle is the humane will. Chriſts praying was the act or deſire of his humane will, though it be true, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99997:23"/>will was acted, influenced, and governed by the Divine will. Hence is that ſaying of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,
<note place="margin">Chriſtus o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat ut ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, ut Deus adoratur, ut homo orat Patrem.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt prays as he is man, as he is God ſo he is prayed unto:</hi> as he is man ſo he intercedes, prays, and ſupplicates to the Father for us.</p>
                  <p>Now we may conſider the love of Chriſt in the deſires that were in his humane will for us. It is true, it was the Godhead that directed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined his humane will to thoſe deſires, and gave that virtue and efficacy to his prayers. If they had been the prayers of a meer man, they had not had ſuch efficacy. But yet we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the love that was in his humane ſoul when he prayed here on earth for us. There was no ſmall love in the Humane ſoul of Chriſt, when he asked ſuch great things for us a little before his going out of the world. It is true, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane love is not all or the principal thing to be conſidered in the great things he asked for us. If his love had not been more than the love of a man, he could not have asked ſuch great things for us, as we read of in <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. yet certainly there was a great deal of love in his humane ſoul, which was filled by the Divinity inhabiting in it. His heart was brim-full of love when he came to make that laſt prayer of his to the Father for us. Judge of his love by the things he asks for us.
<note place="margin">Cujus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiani cor non lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcit dum manifeſtè cognoſcit Filium Dei aeternum pro ſe rogâſſe Patrem, ut unum ſit cum ipſis?</note> What are the things Chriſt asks? No leſs than Union with himſelf and the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21, 23. It is a good ſpeech of one of the Ancients: <q>What Chriſtian heart is it that doth not melt when he doth clearly underſtand that the eternal Son of God did ask for him in particular, that he might be one with him and the Father?</q> Can we deſire a greater happineſs than this, to be one
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99997:23"/>with the Father and the Son? This is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Chriſt asks for us, that we might be one in the Father and the Son. And as he prays for this Union, the top of all, ſo he prays for many other bleſſings; as,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Father would keep all that are his through his own Name, <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. How would he have them kept? He would have them kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this union. So it follows, <hi>That they may be one as we are one.</hi> As the Father and the Son had intended the Elect unto this union, ſo he prays that they may be preſerved unto this union: preſerved unto eternal life, preſerved from miſcarrying, that they might come unto that union the Father and the Son had elected them unto. What comfort is this, that our Lord Jeſus hath prayed we may be kept to our laſt happineſs, that God would be his own power keep us to Salvation? The Salvation of the Elect muſt needs be ſecure, when Chriſt hath prayed the Father, that he would keep all his by his own power to Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He prays that we might be kept from the evil of the world, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. You that fear to be overtaken with any ſcandalous ſin, you may know the worth of this prayer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He prays for our Sanctification, <hi>verſ.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He prays that we might be where he is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He prays that we might have a ſhare in his Glory; not only that we might be with him, but alſo behold the glory that the Father had given him. What love muſt that heart needs be filled with, that prays for ſuch things. It is true, it was not the love of a meer man that could ask ſuch
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99997:24"/>things; but it was the Divine love filling his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul and acting of it, that carried him forth to ask ſuch things. And thus I have finiſhed the conſideration of the love that was in the humane nature of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the love that is in Chriſts Divine nature. The love which is in the humane nature is very great; but the love of the Divine nature is infinitely greater. The love which is in the Divine nature is the fountain and ſpring of all the love that is in the humane nature, and it was meet we ſhould contemplate a little the love that was in Chriſts humane nature, that by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration we might riſe up to contemplate the love of the Divine nature, which is the fountain and head-ſpring. Now to help us a little to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the love which is in the Divine nature of Chriſt, I ſhall propound you three conſiderations to illuſtrate it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All the love of the Father reſides and is to be found in the Divine nature of the Son. The Scripture, when it ſpeaks of the love of God, doth all along commend and ſet forth the love of God the Father. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath ſhewed us,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the love of God,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 16.14. The love of God, that is, the love of the Father: for when Chriſt and God are ſet in diſtinction, by God we are to underſtand the firſt perſon of the Trinity, the Father. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> that is, God the Father. Still we ſee the Scripture deſcribes the Father to us as the fountain of love. As the Father is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of the <hi>Deity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> ſo he is the fountain of love. Now then if all the love of the Father reſides and is to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99997:24"/>be found in the Son, then certainly the Divine nature of the Son muſt needs be full of love: but ſo it is, the whole intire love of the Father is to be found in the Divine nature of the Son; and the reaſon is, becauſe there is but one and the ſame Divine nature in the Father and in the Son.

                        </gap>.</note> The Father and the Son are not of <hi>alike</hi> Eſſence, but they are of the <hi>ſame Eſſence,</hi> and becauſe of the <hi>ſameneſs</hi> of the Eſſence in the Father and in the Son, there is the ſame love in the Father and in the Son. Love is an eſſential property belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Eſſence of God; there being the ſame Eſſence both in the Father and the Son, there muſt needs be the ſame love in both. The Father communicates all he is and hath to the Son in the eternal Generation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.15. <hi>All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath is mine:</hi> therefore the Son receiving all from the Father in the eternal Generation, the whole intire love of the Father is communicated to him, and reſides in him. Therefore he is called the <hi>expreſs</hi> image of his perſon, the brightneſs of his glory, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. The whole nature of the Father is to be ſeen and is made conſpicuous in the perſon of the Son. Therefore if we conclude, that there is the higheſt and moſt immenſe love in the Father, we muſt neceſſarily conclude there is the ſame love in the Son, who is the expreſs image of his perſon. Hence is that expreſſion of our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.21. <hi>If any man love me, he ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, <hi>my Father will love him, and I will love him.</hi> We may not conceive there is a twofold love, one of the Father, and another of the Son, but both Father and Son do love with the ſame love. There is but one and the ſame Divine love in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99997:25"/>Father and the Son. It is true, if we underſtand it as ſome do, of the love that is in Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, then we may ſuppoſe a twofold love; and ſo there is a Learned man that gives this ſenſe, My Father will love him, and I will love him, <hi>i. e.</hi> I will love him, not as God only (for ſo the Father and the Son love with one love) but I will love him as man alſo.

                     </label> We have heard a little of the ſweetneſs of Chriſts love, not only in the properties of it, but as this love is to be found in both his natures. Behold here matter for <hi>new wonder.</hi> Well may we cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O the heights, and depths, and breadths, and lengths of the love of Chriſt!</hi> Here is love, the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious love in both the natures of the Lord Jeſus, in his humane, and in his Divine nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Great was his love in his humane nature; his humane nature was filled with that love that no creature was filled with: great are the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are ſeated in his humane heart, never ſo much ſweetneſs, kindneſs, tenderneſs, compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateneſs to be found in any heart as his. Never
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99997:25"/>any thing ſo ſweet, ſo lovely, ſo amiable in the whole Creation of God as the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Thou art fairer than the ſons of men,</hi> Pſal. 45.2. The humane ſoul of Chriſt was compoſed and made up all of love and ſweetneſs: yea, the humane nature was the receptacle as it were, into which the Divinity poured forth all its love. <hi>In him dwells all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, Col.</hi> 2.9. It is not a <hi>particle</hi> or ſome ſmall portion of the Divinity, but the fulneſs of the Godhead; and if all the fulneſs of the Godhead, then all the fulneſs of Divine love dwells in the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſſumed. Not that the love of the <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> is <hi>formally</hi> and eſſentially the ſame with the Divine love, or that the love which immediately flows from his humane will and affections, is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply infinite as the Divine love is, (although it is a far greater love than ever was found in the heart of any creature) but thus we may conceive of it. The <hi>Humanity</hi> is as it were the ſeat of the Divine perſon; in this humane nature that perſon (who is love it ſelf) dwells. Gods nature is love: now in the humane nature aſſumed, that very perſon (who is love it ſelf) dwells and takes up his abode; how ſweet, how full of love muſt the heart of Chriſt be, that hath <hi>love</hi> it ſelf dwelling and inhabiting in it!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is the love of the Divine nature: and how great that love is, no heart can conceive, no tongue can expreſs. A few words from hence to Sinners, and to the Saints of God.</p>
                  <p>O that poor Sinners would be perſwaded to look after a ſhare in this love. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Never will you find any love to match this love: you may go from creature to creature, but never find any
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99997:26"/>love like the love of Chriſt. Look upon the love of Chriſt-man, it is the ſweeteſt love that ever was, never any created love like to his; but then look to his Divine love, and where will you find a parallel? What are a few drops to the Ocean? All the love that is ſcattered among the creatures, is but as a drop; the Godhead, that is the Sea and Ocean of love. Here are you drawn by a double cord of love, by the love of his humanity and his Divinity. When Chriſt would win upon ſouls, how doth he do it? He ſets his love before them, <hi>I love them that love me,</hi> Prov. 8.17. <hi>If any man love me, he ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, Joh.</hi> 14.21. Love is the thing which is moſt naturally loved: who can withſtand the power of love? Can you hear of all this love in the heart of this amiable perſon the Lord Jeſus, and not find it in your hearts to love him? Never will you find ſo much love and ſweetneſs any where elſe as in the Lord Jeſus. The things that have been ſet before you are the greateſt reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and not meer notions of words or love. We hear much of love in this world, men ſpeak much of love; but the love that is ſpoken of in the world, is for the moſt part nothing but <hi>words</hi> and <hi>air,</hi> there is little reality in it; but the love of Chriſt is the moſt real, ſolid, ſubſtantial love. Here is the love of God himſelf, the love of the Divinity, here is love lodged in a part of your own nature, lodged in that nature which is akin to you: here is the love of your own fleſh and blood: ſhould not the conſideration of this ſweet matchleſs love of Chriſt joyned with the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of your extreme miſery and neceſſity make up the moſt powerful argument to draw ſouls
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99997:26"/>to Chriſt? Here you have the ſweeteſt and moſt glorious love in the world to invite you on the one hand, and on the other you have the neceſſity of your own miſery. <hi>

                  <p>WE are yet under the conſideration of the Love that is in Chriſts Divine Nature, we have mentioned one conſideration about it, the ſecond follows.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration about the love that is in Chriſts Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> To help us to conceive of the love that is in the Divine nature of Chriſt, conſider, That love is moſt natural to God. We have heard in the firſt conſideration, That the Divine nature of the Father is in the Son. As the Father hath the whole nature of God in him, ſo the Son hath the whole nature of God in him; therefore doth <hi>John</hi> ſay of the Son, <hi>This is the true God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20. The Father and the Son are but one and the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99997:27"/>ſame true God. Now love is moſt natural to God, love is his very Eſſence: hence it is ſaid, <hi>God is love,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.7. I do not remember in all the Scripture, that God is called anger, wrath, or hatred. It is true, anger, wrath, hatred are attributed to God, but I do not remember that it is <hi>formally</hi> or categorically expreſſed thus, that God is wrath, anger, hatred; but, <hi>God is love,</hi> his very nature and eſſence is love. In ſome ſenſe we may ſay, Had it not been for ſin, there had been no ſuch thing as hatred in God. Not that we do or can ſuppoſe that there are, or can be any new <hi>immanent acts</hi> in God, for then it could not be ſaid, that God was without <hi>varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> or <hi>ſhadow</hi> of change, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. God always was what now he is: God was from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that which now he is: all the change is from the creatures part, there is no change in God: what God is once he is for ever, there is no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of change in him. But thus we ought to conceive of it, That property in God whereby he is inclined to hate ſin, which is natural and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to him (as the Pſalmiſt tells us, <hi>Thou loveſt righteouſneſs, and hateſt iniquity</hi>) had never had an object to work upon, had not ſin entred into the world. But now God had himſelf and his own goodneſs to love, had there been no ſuch thing as ſin for him to hate; therefore love is moſt natural to God: it is moſt natural to God to love, yea it were a wonder he ſhould not love. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerves, it is as natural for God to love, as it is for him to <hi>be</hi> and <hi>live.</hi> God is an <hi>intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Being,</hi> and being ſo, he muſt needs know, underſtand, and love himſelf: and God being a <hi>pure Act,</hi> he cannot ſometimes love, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99997:28"/>not love, but as he knows himſelf always, ſo he loves himſelf always. It is true, Gods love to the creature is not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> as it is to himſelf. God loves himſelf neceſſarily, but he loves the creatures freely and arbitrarily: but yet thus we ought to conceive of it, God being love, love being his very nature and eſſence, God loves the creatures <hi>freely</hi> indeed, but yet he loves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>condecency,</hi> or <hi>becomingneſs</hi> of his own goodneſs. What ſo proper to Love, as to love? God is love, <note place="margin">Bonum eſt ſui ipſius diffuſivum.</note> and therefore he loveth us. The more good any thing is, the more diffuſive it is of it ſelf. God is good by nature and eſſence, there is no <hi>one good but God, Mat.</hi> 19.17. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are good by participation, but they are not originally, eſſentially good; but the Eſſence of God is goodneſs: therefore God being goodneſs it ſelf, it is moſt agreeable to his nature to impart and communicate good to the creature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <note place="margin">The third Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> The love that is in the Godhead or Divine nature in Chriſt, is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of all the love that is to be found in his humane nature. The humane nature indeed is the <hi>glaſs</hi> in which the perfections of the Divine nature do ſhine forth, but the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is the ſource and ſpring of all. Gods love is moſt viſible to us in the effects of it: that God ſhould be incarnate and become man; that the Law ſhould be fulfilled for us; that the pains and torments of Hell ſhould be ſuffered and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for us; that our nature ſhould be carried into Heaven and filled with glory there: theſe are the effects of Divine love, and theſe effects of love are made <hi>viſible</hi> and <hi>conſpicuous</hi> in the humane nature; but the Divine nature is the <hi>principal Efficient</hi> in all theſe: For mark it, it is the Divine
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99997:28"/>nature, in the perſon of the Son, which ſanctifies the humanity and aſſumes it into unity of perſon, that carries forth the humanity as to all actions and ſufferings; ſo that if theſe be demonſtrations of the higheſt love, for God to dwell in our nature, to ſee the Law fulfilled for us, to ſee the torments and pains of Hell undergone for us, to ſee Divine Juſtice ſatisfied for us, we ought to behold and contemplate the love of the Divine nature as the firſt root of theſe things; for it is the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is the principal efficient cauſe of all. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. There was the love of the humanity which did concur in Chriſts laying down his life for us. <hi>That the world may know, that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even ſo I do, Joh.</hi> 14.31. Chriſt as man loved the Father, and having received a commandment from the Father, he laid down his life for the ſheep. He was willing even as man out of love to the Father and to the ſheep, to lay down his life; but notwithſtanding this, the love that was in his Divine nature was the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal;</hi> therefore doth <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>Hereby we perceive the love of God, that he laid down his life for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. Therefore we ought not to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate our thoughts, or to ſtick meerly in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the actions and ſufferings of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; but we ought to contemplate the love of the Divine nature in all theſe things, for it was the Godhead was the primary and principal cauſe, <note place="margin">Habuit ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſae minùs principalis &amp; mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrae.</note> and the humane nature is to be conſidered as the <hi>leſs principal</hi> cauſe, and as the ſervant to the Divinity. So that whatſoever is ſweet or amiable in Chriſt as man, conſider all his actions and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99997:29"/>ſufferings in the humane nature, and whatſoever may make him amiable in that reſpect, we ought to look to the Divine nature as the principal cauſe, and to the humanity as <hi>acted</hi> by the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: the humanity is the <hi>Organ</hi> of the Divinity in all theſe things. Thus have we paſſed over the ſecond Conſideration, there are <hi>heights,</hi> and <hi>lengths,</hi> and <hi>depths,</hi> and <hi>breadths</hi> in the love of Chriſt, if we conſider the love of Chriſt diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it is to be found in both his natures, in his Divine and humane nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I proceed in the third place to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the effects of Chriſts love. As the love of Chriſt hath heights, depths, lengths, and breadths, and all manner of dimenſions in it, if we conſider it in the properties of it; and as it is to be found in both his natures: ſo it hath the ſame dimenſions in it, if we conſider the effects of his love. The effects of Chriſts love are moſt admirable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt effect of Chriſts love is his <hi>Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> O that God would give us an heart to liſten to the great Myſteries of God that are contained herein as the weight of theſe things requires; that the <hi>Word</hi> ſhould be made <hi>fleſh;</hi> that God ſhould aſſume a part of humane nature, and become true man: here are heights, breadths, lengths, <note place="margin">Opus mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile, opus ſingulare, inter omnia &amp; ſuper omnia ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra ſua.</note> and depths of love indeed. <hi>Bernard</hi> calls the Incarnation of Chriſt a wonderful work, a ſingular work among all the reſt of Gods works, yea above all the reſt of his other works. The work of <hi>Incarnation</hi> is the greateſt of all the works of God, it is a greater work than the creation of Heaven and Earth; for God to make all creatures out of nothing, this is a work ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99997:29"/>to the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God; but for God to come into the nature of his own creature after he hath made it, this is more wonderful. <note place="margin">

                     <hi>What greater Argument of power than to joyn the Creator and the creature in one?</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8. <hi>Made in the likeneſs of men, and found in faſhion as a man.</hi> They are melting expreſſions to any one that weighs them, and conſiders what the meaning of them is. For the God of Heaven to be made in the likeneſs of men, and to be found in faſhion as a man, this will overcome and ſwallow him up that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands a little what the meaning of that is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. This work of Chriſts Incarnation is a ſtupendious work, the greateſt work that ever was done, the greateſt that ever ſhall be done. The glorification of all the Saints in Heaven is not ſo much as this, for the Godhead to dwell perſonally in our nature. This was that made <hi>Cyprian</hi> to ſay, <hi>I do not wonder at the other miracles that are in the world, I wonder at this, that God ſhould be in the womb of a Virgin:</hi> that God who is incorporeal, ſhould cover himſelf with the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of our fleſh: that he who is inviſible, ſhould after a ſort make himſelf viſible: that he who is the immortal God; ſhould become a mortal man: that he who is infinite and uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed, ſhould take to himſelf a finite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, theſe are wonders indeed. But that I may ſpeak a little particularly to ſhew the dimenſions of Chriſts love, to ſhew what are the heights, breadths, lengths, and depths of Chriſts love in the work of Incarnation, I ſhall propound ſeveral things. Oh let us conſider the wonders that are in this Myſtery of the Incarnation of the Son of God. The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That God ſhould chuſe to manifeſt his love to man this way. When God would manifeſt his love to man to the <hi>uttermoſt,</hi> he <hi>himſelf</hi> would become man. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> Here is the Myſtery of myſteries, the Wonder of wonders, that God ſhould take fleſh. So great was this Myſtery, that it drew the admiration of Angels; therefore the Apoſtle, after he had declared the ſum of this Myſtery, <note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> that God was manifeſted in the fleſh, he adds this, <hi>he was ſeen of Angels,</hi> or he appeared to Angels. What is the meaning of that? The meaning is, he appeared <hi>viſibly in fleſh</hi> to Angels. He was ſeen in his ſimple naked Divinity of Angels before his Incarnation; but God was never ſeen as made viſible in the fleſh, <note place="margin">

                     </note> until after the Son of God was incarnate and made man, the Angels beheld this ſight (God made viſible in fleſh) with wonder and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And another Learned man hath this expreſſion concerning it: <hi>He was ſeen of Angels, the moſt auguſt Majeſty of this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery could not be ſet forth more magnificently than by this that it is ſaid, He was ſeen of Angels:</hi> for no doubt it was an incredible delight to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to ſee God made fleſh, as appears from that Song of theirs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the world.</hi> He loved the world, and he <hi>ſo</hi> loved it. God might have loved the world, and not have <hi>ſo</hi> loved it. God might have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:99997:30"/>his love to man in ſome other way, and not ſo as to ſend his Son into the nature of man. It was great love for God to create man at firſt after his own image, and if God had confirmed man in his firſt eſtate (as the elect Angels were) ſo that man had never ſinned and fallen, this had been great love: but when man was fallen, for God to ſend his Son into the nature of man to recover man, this was greater love. This is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by that Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Verily he took not on him the nature of Angels.</hi> It is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a Learned man, the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of the <hi>good Angels.</hi> The good Angels we know are confirmed in grace, ſo that they never fell; but the Son of God took not on him the nature of Angels; this was an honour caſt upon poor man more than on the Angels, that the Son of God came into the nature of man, not into the nature of Angels. But here the obſervation of <hi>Calvin</hi> muſt be taken in, That the Son of God hath preferred us above the Angels, this is not to be underſtood in reſpect of the dignity or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of our nature, but in reſpect of our miſery. Look upon angelical nature ſimply, and that is ſuperiour to humane nature; and therefore it is ſaid of man, that he was made <hi>a little lower than the Angels.</hi> Therefore there is no cauſe (as <hi>Calvin</hi> goes on) that we ſhould glory as being ſuperiour to Angels, unleſs it be in this reſpect, that God hath ſhewed greater mercy to us, which was that we needed: ſo that the Angels themſelves have reaſon to ſtand and admire from on high, that goodneſs that is beſtowed upon poor man here on earth. However this is clear, that it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt demonſtration of Gods love, that God ſhould
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99997:31"/>take the nature of man, and in this reſpect there is an honour caſt upon humane nature more than upon Angelical nature. God did not come into the nature of Angels, but into the nature of man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, That ſo great a perſon ſhould come into our nature: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.7. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Son is born.</hi> But who and what is this Son? His <hi>name is Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, the mighty God, the everlaſting God.</hi> He is ſo the <hi>Son,</hi> as that he is alſo the <hi>mighty God.</hi> He is ſo the Son of the everlaſting Father, as that he himſelf is alſo the everlaſting Father of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He is the Son, yet the <hi>mighty</hi> God, the <hi>everlaſting</hi> Father: therefore is it ſaid concerning him, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God: by him all things were made, and without him was not any thing made that was made, Joh.</hi> 1.12, 13. This Son had not his exiſtence firſt of all when he took fleſh from the Virgin: he was the Son before and God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.24, 25, 26. <hi>When there was no depths was I brought forth.</hi> Micah 5.2. <hi>His goings forth were from everlaſting.</hi> Now that this great perſon, this eternal perſon ſhould be incarnate, and take to himſelf a created nature in time, this ſets forth the greatneſs of his love.

Now that he who was known and worſhipped by the Angels in Heaven as <hi>God</hi> before his Incarnation, that he ſhould come

Now that ſo great a perſon ſhould come into our nature, this is another thing doth commend to us the love of Chriſt in his Incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the great condeſcenſion of that perſon who aſſumed our nature. Here we muſt inquire, wherein did the condeſcenſion of Chriſt appear in his Incarnation or in his aſſumption of our nature? I ſhall open that in ſeveral particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In that the Son of God came into a nature ſo <hi>inferiour</hi> to his own. What compariſon is there between God and the creature? That the eternal God ſhould joyn himſelf ſo nearly to the nature of his own creature, this is admirable. This was that made <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay, <hi>When I conſider the perſon of him who comes,
<note place="margin">Dignatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem expaveſco.</note> I cannot comprehend the excellency of his Majeſty; when I conſider to whom he comes, I tremble at the greatneſs of his condeſcenſion.</hi> To whom was it that this great perſon came? He came to us poor men, who dwell in houſes of clay. And will God indeed dwell with men? Yea he dwells with man: <hi>The Word was made fleſh,
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> and dwelt among us, Joh.</hi> 1.14. He pitched his Tent and Tabernacle in a part of our nature; he did not only converſe familiarly, and was ſeen among men, but he pitched his Tent and Tabernacle in a part of our nature. <hi>Without controverſie great
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99997:32"/>is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh.</hi> God was in that very fleſh which the Son of God aſſumed. God was in that fleſh that was once ſeen here on earth, and was afterwards given as a Sacrifice for the life of the world, yea ſo in it as to dwell <hi>perſonally</hi> in it. Therefore doth the Son of God call the fleſh he aſſumed <hi>his own fleſh, Joh.</hi> 6.53. Now conſider it, what a diſproportion is there between God and our fleſh? Yet the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word is made fleſh, he who was with God in the beginning, and who was God, this very Word is made fleſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. It is a notable expreſſion one uſeth to illuſtrate this: <hi>Although it was not ſuitable to humane fleſh, according to the condition of its own nature, to be united to God in the unity of perſon; yet this was becoming God, in the infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of his own goodneſs.</hi> It was nothing but infinite goodneſs could move God to condeſcend ſo low as to take a part of our fleſh, and cloath himſelf with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The condeſcenſion of Chriſt in his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears in this, in that the Son of God took a part of our nature, after humane nature had been infected, and when the whole maſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature lay infected with original ſin. Let none miſtake here, that part of humane nature which was united to the perſon of the Son of God, had no taint or pollution of ſin in it; but thus we ought to conceive of it: The maſs of humane nature out of which this part or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of humane nature was taken, was infected with original ſin, and in the ſame moment that the <hi>Word,</hi> the ſecond perſon in Trinity, joyned himſelf to our nature, that part or parcel of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature that was joyned to his perſon, was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99997:32"/>ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that in the ſame moment or inſtant the union was made, that part of humane nature which was aſſumed was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Holy Ghoſt: neither was it ſanctified before aſſumed, nor aſſumed before ſanctified, but both were done in the ſame inſtant: as ſoon as there was fleſh, ſo ſoon was it the fleſh of the Word. We muſt not ſuppoſe any inſtant of time, when that part of humane nature that was joyned to the Son of God, ſhould have a ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence of its own before it was united to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: no, but at the ſame time it was fleſh,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> at the ſame time it was <hi>the fleſh</hi> of the Word: but this is that which commends the love of Chriſt, and his great condeſcenſion, that he ſhould take part of our nature, when the whole maſs of it lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the contagion of original ſin. God who was Purity and Holineſs it ſelf, might juſtly have loathed and abhorred ſuch impurity as ours, he might juſtly have diſdained to have ſought out a habitation for himſelf among ſuch polluted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. None of the children of <hi>Adam</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt and free from the contagion of original ſin, no not the Virgin her ſelf, who was the Mother of our Lord: now that God ſhould ſeek out and prepare for himſelf a habitation out of ſuch an impure ſink as our nature was, by reaſon of ſin, this is that which greatly commends the love and condeſcenſion of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The greatneſs of Chriſts love in his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with reſpect to his condeſcenſion appears in this, in that he took our nature together with its infirmities: <hi>He was in all things made like to us, ſin only excepted.</hi> The Son of God did not only take fleſh, but he took <hi>paſſible mortal</hi> fleſh, ſuch a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99997:33"/>nature as was ſubject to ſuffering and death, this was a great commendation of his love. For we muſt know the Divinity inhabiting in Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, could have prevented all ſuffering and death: the Godhead which was perſonally united to the humane nature, could have made the humane nature impaſſible and above ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Therefore it is obſerved by a Learned man: <hi>It was by the good pleaſure of the Divine will,
<note place="margin">Beneplacito Divinae vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis permitteba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur carni pati &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perari quae propria.</note> that it was permitted to the humanity to do and ſuffer the things which were proper to it ſelf.</hi> The great end why the Son of God aſſumed our nature was, that he might ſatisfie for the ſins of men. Now one is then ſaid to ſatisfie for the offence of another, when he takes upon himſelf the puniſhment that is due for ſuch offences: now ſuffering and death was the puniſhment due for ſin. <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin,</hi> Rom. 5. Therefore the Son of God out of his great love to us was not only willing to take our nature, but alſo the infirmities of our nature: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4. <hi>He hath born our griefs,
<note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. The greatneſs of Chriſts condeſcenſion in his Incarnation appears in this, in that he ſuffered <hi>the glory of his Divinity to be hid and veiled</hi> for a time in our nature, after he had aſſumed it. This is that which the Scripture calls his <hi>emptying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

<note place="margin">Habitu in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus eſt ut ſimplex homo.</note> he was found in faſhion, habit, and appearance as a meer man. He did for a time keep in and hide the glory of his Divinity, and did not diſplay the brightneſs of it, as he might have done.
<note place="margin">Non potuit Chriſtus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicare ſe Divinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, ſed eam occultam te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuit.</note> It was not poſſible for the Son of God to diveſt himſelf of his Divinity, but he hid his Divinity and kept it ſecret. The Son of God, when incarnate and become man, when he was in the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, did not ceaſe to be the Son of God and true God; but for as much as the Divinity lying hid in that fleſh of his, did not manifeſt it ſelf preſently, nor at all times, nor in all things, nor ſo clearly nor perfectly as afterwards; therefore he is ſaid to empty himſelf, as <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerves, therefore our Tranſlation renders it, <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation.</hi> He did not obtain that reputation of the generality of men, as to be thought to be what he was: he was in the form of God, true God, equal with the Father, but taking upon him the form of a ſervant; being found in faſhion as a man, he was called the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Son, and owned by the generality of men as no other but the Son of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary.</hi> Look
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99997:34"/>as the light and glory of the Sun is hid and veiled by ſome dark cloud interpoſing; ſo the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was as a cloud that veiled his Divinity: the Divinity repreſſing and keeping in its own rays from breaking forth ſo illuſtriouſly. In the time of his humiliation, when the Lord Jeſus did but let forth ſome beams of his Divinity in his Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration, the Evangeliſt tells us, That his face did ſhine as the Sun, and his raiment was white as the light, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.20. Now he that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that glory at one time, might have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo always if he pleaſed. This ſight was ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that the Diſciples who were with him could not behold it long, but they fell upon <hi>their face and were ſore afraid.</hi> This is an argument that he contained and kept in the beams of his glory at other times. It is true, the Lord Jeſus did upon occaſion let forth the glory of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity in his Miracles, and otherwiſe, and thoſe who were ſpiritually illuminated and had fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar converſe with him, beheld his glory as the <hi>glory of the only begotten Son of God,</hi> Joh. 1.14. But they were but a few in compariſon, that had this knowledge in the days of his fleſh here on earth. The Son of God did ſo far contain and keep in his glory, that it may be truly ſaid he made himſelf of no reputation, that is, he was not ſeen and acknowledged to be what indeed he was, by the generality of men. Hence are theſe expreſſions of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2. <hi>He hath no form nor comelineſs: and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> Now this is a great Argument of the condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Lord Jeſus, that when he might have let forth the glory of his Divinity in ſuch a way,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99997:34"/>that he might have convinced all men, that he was true God; yet he was pleaſed ſo far to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and keep in his own glory, that he might accompliſh the work of his Mediatorſhip, and thereby our Salvation. If he had not hid and kept in as it were the glory of his Divinity, he could not have ſuffered and dyed; and if he had not ſuffered and dyed, what had become of our Salvation? The day is coming when the Lord Jeſus ſhall appear in the glory of his Divinity in the humane nature he hath aſſumed, ſo as that he ſhall be acknowledged to be God by all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Every tongue ſhall confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord to the glory of God the Father.</hi> How is this, to the glory of God the Father? Why, thus we ought to conceive of it: When Chriſt ſhall come to Judgment, he ſhall come in <hi>the glory of his Father, Mat.</hi> 16.27. The glory of the Son and the Father is but one and the ſame glory; the Divinity of the Son and the Father is one and the ſame: therefore when the Son comes in the glory of the Father, he ſhall come in the glory of his own and his Fathers Divinity. What is it to appear in the Divinity of himſelf and Father? What is it for the Son to come in the glory of his own and the Fathers Divinity? Certainly, it is to manifeſt the glory of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in and by the humane nature aſſumed; there ſhall be ſo clear a manifeſtation of God in the perſon of the Son, when he comes to Judgment, that all men ſhall know that Jeſus Chriſt is true God as well as true Man. Now that which Chriſt will certainly do when he comes to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> he will manifeſt the glory of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity to all men in and by the humane nature
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99997:35"/>aſſumed, he could have done, if he had pleaſed, whilſt he was on earth; but here lay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his condeſcenſion, That he was pleaſed to hide and keep ſecret in a great meaſure the glory of his Divinity, that he might accompliſh the work of our Salvation. And here we may cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>Oh the heights,</hi> &amp;c. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, ſtand and wonder at this love! Man out of the pride of his heart will be as God (<hi>Ye ſhall be as Gods, Gen.</hi> 3.5.) God out of the greatneſs of his love will become man: and though he continues to be God ſtill when he is become man too; yet ſuch is the humility of God incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that he is content to lay aſide the glory of his Divinity, that he might exalt man that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to dethrone and depreſs him. Should not this love overcome us? Oh what dull and ſtupid hearts have we, that theſe wonders do not affect us!</p>

                  <p n="4">4. THE greatneſs of the love of Chriſt in his Incarnation may be ſeen in the nearneſs of the Union that is made between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the humane and the Divine nature in the perſon of the Son of God. The humanity of Chriſt, by virtue of this union, is become the Spouſe as it were of the Divinity. God hath married himſelf to our nature, the Son of God hath given his own perſon to it: the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath drawn the humane nature into that moſt excellent unity of the Divine perſon; ſo that now there is but one and the ſame perſon of the Divine nature and the humane nature aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: ſo that the humane nature (as it is well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by one) is by means of this union <hi>rooted</hi> in the <hi>Divine ſtock.</hi> To underſtand this, we muſt know that the Son of God was a perſon before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and ſubſiſted in the Divine nature; by the work of his Incarnation the humane nature having no ſubſiſtence of its own, hath the Divine perſon of the Son communicated to it, and ſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99997:36"/>ſubſiſts in and by that perſon: ſo that now here is one and the ſame perſon that ſubſiſts in two natures. The ſame perſon who ſubſiſted in the Divine nature only, before his Incarnation; after his Incarnation ſubſiſts in both natures, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane nature. All this is implied in that great Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh.</hi> The Evangeliſt ſpeaks of Chriſt the Son of God, the eternal Word; <hi>The Word was made fleſh,</hi> that is, the Son of God, the ſecond perſon in Trinity was <hi>made fleſh,</hi> or became man. That Chriſt was a perſon, and had his ſubſiſtence in the Divine nature before his Incarnation, that the Evangeliſt had ſhewn us in the two firſt verſes, <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God:</hi> Here the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt ſhews us plainly, that Chriſt had his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence before his Incarnation, he ſubſiſted in the Divine nature, he ſubſiſted with the Father in the ſame Divine Eſſence. Now after he comes to acquaint us, that this very perſon whom he calls the <hi>Word,</hi> and who did firſt of all ſubſiſt in the nature of God only, did afterwards <hi>become man,</hi> and was <hi>made fleſh;</hi> and after his Incarnation ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in both natures, the nature of man as well as the nature of God, who before his Incarnation ſubſiſted in the nature of God only. <hi>The Word was made fleſh.</hi> How is this to be underſtood, <hi>made fleſh?</hi> Not by any converſion in the <hi>natures,</hi> as if ſo be the Divinity was abſorpt by, or turned into the humanity, or as if ſo be the humanity was ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into the Divinity: but the <hi>Word is made fleſh,</hi> thus we ought to conceive of it, the Word, that is, the <hi>eternal Word,</hi> the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, who was a <hi>perſon before,</hi> draws the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:99997:36"/>nature into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of his own perſon, ſo that the natures remain diſtinct and unconfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the perſon is but one. The Word who was a perſon before his Incarnation, aſſumes and takes the humane nature (deſtitute of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal ſubſiſtence of its own) into the unity of his own perſonal ſubſiſtence; ſo that now by means of the Incarnation of the Word, there is one and the ſame perſon of the Word and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature aſſumed. This is in ſhort the ſum of that Doctrine which we call the Hypoſtatical, or perſonal Union; which is therefore called the Hypoſtatical or perſonal Union, becauſe both the natures, the Divine and the humane nature are united into that one <hi>Hypoſtaſis</hi> or perſon of the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Now conſider the greatneſs of Chriſts love in this Union. This union (the union of the two natures in that one perſon of Chriſt) is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all unions, next to the union of the three perſons of the Sacred Trinity, which indeed may not ſo properly be called a <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> as a <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Summa illa Trinítas nobis hanc exhibuit Trinitatem.</note> The higheſt Trinity hath exhibited to us this Trinity, that theſe three, the Word, the fleſh and humane ſoul of Chriſt ſhould be one: one not by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſubſtance, but one in perſon. In the Sacred Trinity the perſons remain diſtinct, but the nature is one; in the <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> the natures remain diſtinct, but the perſon is but one. Now this is the higheſt of all unions next that of the three perſons in the Trinity in one and the ſame Eſſence: namely, that a <hi>created nature,</hi> as the humane nature in Chriſt is, ſhould be made one perſon with the Son of God, who alſo himſelf is God. By this union God communicates himſelf
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99997:37"/>after the higheſt manner that was poſſible unto the creature; and the nature of the creature is united to God in the moſt perfect manner as it was poſſible for the creature to be united to God. In the Incarnation of the Son of God, man who is the laſt creature in Creation, is joyned with his firſt Cauſe and Principle, in ſuch a union, as that there is none greater under God. To illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate yet farther the greatneſs of this union that is made in the two natures, in the perſon of Chriſt, conſider, There is a preſence of God, and an inhabitation of his Spirit in the Saints; but this falls far ſhort of the <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which we are now ſpeaking of: for notwithſtanding the myſtical Union, notwithſtanding the inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit in Believers, yet a Believer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a <hi>true perſon,</hi> the perſon of a Believer and the perſon of Chriſt remain diſtinct perſons, though Chriſt and Believers be one myſtically and ſpiritually. The Scripture, <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> There is a myſtical, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Union between Chriſt and Believers, yet Chriſt and Believers remain diſtinct in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but in this other union (the perſonal union, the union of the two natures in the perſon of Chriſt) the humane nature of Chriſt hath no ſubſiſtence of its own, but ſubſiſts wholly in and by the perſon of the Son of God, who was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from Eternity, and gives his own perſon to the humane nature deſtitute of any perſonality of its own; ſo that could we ſuppoſe it were poſſible for the humane nature to be deſerted by the Divine perſon that ſupports it, it would be reduced to nothing: ſo that here is a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between this union and all other unions.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99997:37"/>Yet a little farther to illuſtrate this:</p>
                  <p>It is the obſervation of a Learned Divine, this Union is ſo near, individual, inſeparable, indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, that the Divine nature of the Son will not, cannot, ought not to be thought on, ſought for, apprehended out of this union which it hath with the humane nature; but it ought to be thought of, ſought for, apprehended in that moſt near union and conjunction it hath with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity: and the humane nature, which is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ought not not to be thought of, conceived, or apprehended out of, but within the moſt intimate embracings of the ſecond perſon in Trinity who aſſumed it. And that God is not to be ſought for any where but in Chriſt, is clear from that paſſage, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.20. <hi>The Son of God is come, and hath given us an underſtanding, that we might know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt, this is the true God.</hi> The ſum of this Scripture, ſaith <hi>Calvin,</hi> is this: When once we have Chriſt, then we have the true and eternal God, becauſe God is to be ſought for no where elſe. The Son of God hath ſo aſſumed a part of our nature, as that he hath made it his own proper fleſh; ſo that, that body which he hath aſſumed, is not the body of any other perſon, or individual, but it is the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per body</hi> of the Son of God; therefore is it called the <hi>Temple</hi> of his body, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.21. elſewhere it is ſaid, Feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. And we have that expreſſion, <hi>The body of his fleſh, Col.</hi> 1.22. That particle or parcel of our nature which the Son of God aſſumed and took up, was ſo individually, inſeparably, indiſſolubly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:99997:38"/>united to him, that it became his own proper fleſh; therefore is it ſaid, <hi>The bread I will give is my fleſh, Joh.</hi> 6.51. To ſum up this particular, what love is this, that the Son of God, ſo great a perſon as we have heard, ſhould take up a part of our nature, joyn it to himſelf in the bond of near union, and doth wear it, and will wear it to all Eternity!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The admirableneſs of the work of Chriſts Incarnation appears in this, in that by means of the Incarnation all the Trinity are brought near to us, and by the Son incarnate we come to have communion with all the Trinity. Hence is that expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.24. <hi>If that which ye have heard from the beginning ſhall remain in you, ye alſo ſhall continue in the Son and in the Father.</hi> By continuing in the Son we come to continue in the Father. This is the order, we muſt continue in the Son, if ever we mean to continue in the Father. He had ſaid before, <hi>He that denies the Son, the ſame hath not the Father,</hi> now he ſaith, By abiding in the doctrine of the Son, we ſhall continue in the Son and in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What is the doctrine of the Son, which if we continue in, we ſhall continue in the Son and in the Father? The doctrine of the Son is, That the Word is made fleſh. Compare this with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. and 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. and we ſhall ſee it clear, that the doctrine concerning the Son is, That the Son is come into the fleſh, or that the Word is made fleſh. Now by continuing in this doctrine we ſhall continue in the Father: by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the doctrine of the Son incarnate, we ſhall continue in the Father. How ſo? <hi>He that hath the Son hath the Father.</hi> The Divinity of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99997:38"/>the Father is brought down to us in the perſon of the Son incarnate. It is a great ſpeech of a Learned Divine:
<note place="margin">Divinitas in una ſui hypoſtaſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

                     <hi>The whole Divinity hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated it ſelf to us in the Incarnation of one of the Perſons.</hi> To underſtand which, we muſt know, although the Son only be the perſon who is incarnate, not the Father, or the Spirit, yet both the Father and the Spirit are to be found in that one perſon of the Son who is incarnate; and the reaſon is, becauſe the Divine perſons, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are diſtinct, yet they have an inbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in each other, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10. <hi>The Father is in the Son,</hi> and the Spirit proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son; ſo that in the perſon of the Son who only is incarnate, the other perſons are to be found. Hence is that ſpeech of <hi>Luther,</hi> and it is a great ſpeech:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi ille Deus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Jeſus eſt, ibi eſt totus Deus ſeu tota Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitas, ibi invenitur Pater &amp; Spiritus S.</hi> Luther.</note> 
                     <hi>Where that God Chriſt Jeſus is, there is whole God, or the whole Divinity, there the Father and the holy Spirit is found.</hi> The Son hath aſſumed our nature, now the Father is in the Son, and the Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son; therefore in the Son incarnate all the Trinity are repreſented to us. We begin firſt of all at the fleſh of Chriſt, we conceive firſt of all of the humanity of Chriſt, and from thence we aſcend to the contemplation of the Divinity of the Son inhabiting and dwelling in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and by that means we come to communion with the whole Trinity. This may be illuſtrated further to us by two Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. At the ſame time we apprehend the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Son, we do alſo apprehend the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Father. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.9. <hi>He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father.</hi> There is one and the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99997:39"/>ſame undivided Divinity,
<note place="margin">Trium per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonarum u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, eadem, &amp; indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua eſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinicas, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentia, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentia, Sapientia. Eſſentia u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae eſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</note> Eſſence, Omnipotency, Wiſdom of all the three perſons; therefore when we apprehend and conceive of the Divinity of the Son, we do at the ſame time apprehend the Divinity of the Father and Spirit, which is common to all the three perſons. The eſſence of one perſon is the eſſence of another. We muſt not fancy or imagine, becauſe we ſpeak of more perſons than one in the Deity, therefore there are more Deities; as if there were as many Deities as perſons: no, all the three perſons are but one and the ſelf ſame Deity or Godhead: and when we apprehend the Divinity or Deity of one of the perſons, we apprehend the ſame Deity that is common to them all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the apprehenſion of the perſon of the Son we are led into communion with the Father: ſo that we may ſay with the Apoſtle,
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Divinity of the Father and the Son is the ſame; ſo that when we apprehend the Divinity of the one, we muſt neceſſarily appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Divinity of the other. Yet there is a diſtinction between the Father and the Son, the diſtinction is not in point of Eſſence, for there is one and the ſelf ſame Eſſence or Divinity com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them both. Therefore if there be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the Father and the Son, and that diſtinction be not in point of Eſſence, the diſtinction muſt neceſſarily be conceived to be as to the perſon of the one and of the other: each perſon includes the whole Eſſence; and when we conceive of one perſon, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the whole Eſſence. Yet thus we ought to take it, the ſame Eſſence is to be conceived
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99997:39"/>after a diſtinct manner of ſubſiſting in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the ſelf ſame Eſſence is to be conceived after a diſtinct manner of ſubſiſting in the Son. Or we may take it in other words thus: One and the ſelf ſame God after ſuch a manner of ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the Father: one and the ſame God after ſuch a manner of ſubſiſting is the Son. For that which we call a perſon in the Godhead, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Divine Eſſence it ſelf diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by ſome proper manner of ſubſiſting; as for inſtance; When we conceive of the Father, we conceive of him as the firſt perſon in the Deity, who is of himſelf, and from no other, and gives being to the Son as the Son, this is his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſubſiſting: When we conceive of the Son, we conceive of him as the ſecond perſon in the Deity, who hath the ſame whole and intire nature of God in him as the Father hath; yet as he is the Son, ſo we conceive of him as begotten by the Father, and proceeding from the Father by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation; this is his manner of ſubſiſting. Here is one and the ſelf ſame Eſſence ſtill, the Father hath the whole Eſſence in him, and is depending upon no other: the Son hath the ſame Eſſence; but as he is the Son, ſo he is begotten by the Father, and proceeding from him by eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Generation. Now by the perſon of the Son incarnate we are brought in to communion with the Father. How ſo? Whilſt we apprehend and conceive of the perſon of the Son who is incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, we may reflect upon the Father, from whom the Son proceeds, and between whom and the Father there is the moſt perfect communion of natures, the nature of the Son being the nature of the Father alſo; and thus by having fellowſhip
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99997:40"/>with the Son, we have fellowſhip and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Father alſo. It is a great Scripture to illuſtrate this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in me.</hi>

And he adds: Nothing forbids us but that faith may be in more perſons than one, ſo we be ſure to retain one and the ſelf ſame Eſſence. To underſtand which, we muſt conſider:</p>
                  <p>When we conceive of one perſon in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or direct an act of faith to one perſon, we muſt take in the <hi>whole Deity</hi> or <hi>whole God</hi> in our apprehenſion or conception: when we conceive of another perſon, or direct an act of faith to another perſon of the Trinity, we muſt take in the whole Deity or Eſſence in our apprehenſion: we muſt take heed that we never part or divide the Eſſence in our conception of any of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. When you conceive of each perſon, be ſure you take in the whole Eſſence in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; as for inſtance: When I conceive of God the Father, I conceive of the firſt perſon in the Deity, <hi>whole God</hi> ſubſiſting in the Divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence after ſuch a manner: when I conceive of the Son, I conceive of the ſecond perſon in the Deity, <hi>whole God</hi> ſubſiſting in the Eſſence after ſuch a manner. The Eſſence is common to all the perſons, and the perſons do ſubſiſt in the ſelf ſame Eſſence; therefore in the conception of each perſon, we muſt be ſure to take in the whole
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99997:40"/>Eſſence. Now by the Son incarnate we are brought to communion with the Father; the humanity of Chriſt leads us to the <hi>Divinity,</hi> we begin at the humanity, and we aſcend from thence to the conſideration of <hi>that perſon,</hi> who aſſumed the humane nature. Now in this one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is <hi>whole God,</hi> there is the Divinity of the Father and of the Spirit: now, when by the eye of faith we can contemplate the Divinity in the perſon of the Son, we may be the ſame eye of faith reflect upon the perſon of the Father as ſubſiſting in the ſame Divinity, and who is no otherways diſtinguiſhed from the Son but by his relative property.

                  <p>WE have already mentioned five Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to diſcover the greatneſs of the love of Chriſt in the work of his Incarnation: we now come to the ſixth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth Propoſition is this: The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the love of Chriſt in the work of his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will appear in the great <hi>advancement</hi> that cometh to our nature by the Incarnation of the Son of God. It is the greateſt advancement of humane nature imaginable, that God ſhould take a part of our nature into unity of perſon with himſelf. This I ſhall illuſtrate by four Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By means of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God a part of our nature is advanced above the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Verily he took not on him the nature of Angels.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> The Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb of confirmation, a word that is uſed to aſſert the truth of a thing more vehemently and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The Apoſtle lays much weight and ſtreſs
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99997:44"/>upon this, <hi>Verily he took not upon him the nature of Angels.</hi> It is as much as if he had ſaid, Truly herein is our nature advanced above Angels, in that the Son of God did take part of our nature, and did not aſſume Angelical nature. If we look upon Angelical nature in it ſelf, and conſider the nature of Angels ſimply, ſo Angelical nature is ſuperiour, a nature ſuperiour to our nature; therefore is it ſaid, that man is <hi>made a little lower than the Angels.</hi> Humane nature ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in it ſelf, is inferiour to Angelical nature: but then look upon our nature as it is advanced in Chriſt the Head of the Church, and ſo it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred above Angels; therefore is it ſaid, that Chriſt is <hi>exalted far above principalities and powers, might and dominion, and every name that is names not only in this world, but in that which is to come, Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21. The Apoſtle in that place is ſpeaking of <hi>Chriſt-man:</hi> Now Chriſt-man is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above Principalities and Powers, that is, above the Angels, yea and above every name that is named not only in this world, but in that which is to come: hence is it that the Angels are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>worſhip Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 1.6. Now although it be true, that the Divine nature in Chriſt is the proper and formal object of worſhip, yet the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are commanded to worſhip the Son of God in our nature, to worſhip the Son of God cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our nature. Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>When he brings in his firſt-begotten Son into the world he ſaith, Let all the Angels of God worſhip him.</hi> The Angels were not only to worſhip the Son of God before his Incarnation, but after his Incarnation. The Son of God when incarnate and cloathed with our fleſh, did not ceaſe to be the natural
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99997:44"/>coeſſential Son of God, he was the Son of God, and God, before he took the nature of man upon him: <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God, Joh.</hi> 1.1. This is ſpoken of him before his Incarnation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Angels were to worſhip him before he was cloathed with our nature, ſo they were to worſhip him after he was cloathed with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Conſideration is this: The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our nature by the work of Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears in this, In that by means of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation a part of our nature is joyned to the ſecond perſon in Trinity, continueth in perſonal union with him; ſo that the <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>that Perſon</hi> whom the Scripture calls <hi>the Word,</hi> with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature aſſumed, is, and continues to be the ſecond perſon in Trinity. We have already heard, how that by means of the Incarnation of the Son of God we come to have communion with the whole Trinity. That which I have to add in this Propoſition, is to ſhew what that <hi>near relation</hi> is which the humane nature aſſumed hath unto the Trinity, and how that by means of the perſonal union the <hi>humane nature aſſumed</hi> hath a nearer relation unto the Trinity than any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatſoever. It is a Poſition and a Maxime both of ancient and modern <hi>Divines,</hi>

                        </gap>s.</note> That that perſon of the Trinity whom the Scripture calls the <hi>Word with his proper fleſh</hi> is the ſecond perſon of the Trinity. Now we muſt underſtand this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, when Divines ſay, The Son or the Word with his proper fleſh is the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, 1. we muſt not ſuppoſe that hereby is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any <hi>converſion</hi> in the natures, as if ſo be the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:99997:45"/>humane nature aſſumed were taken into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or eſſence of the Trinity, for that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: we muſt ſtill remember how that the two natures, the Divine and humane nature after this union is made in the perſon of the Son, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways remain eſſentially different and diſtinct: that is, the Divinity doth always remain to be the Divinity, and the humanity to be the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that is, it remains true humane nature after the perſonal Union.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither muſt we ſuppoſe, that the Son of God aſſumes a humane perſon, but a humane nature; for if the Son of God had aſſumed a humane perſon, then there had been a Quater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, not a Trinity, four perſons, not three any longer; and this the doctrine of the Goſpel is moſt abhorring from. For the Goſpel tells us, That there are three that bear record in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>the Father, the Word,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. The Goſpel ſpeaks but of three, and this the Goſpel ſpeaks of after the Incarnation of one of theſe perſons, namely, after the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Word,</hi> which is the ſecond of theſe three; for when <hi>John</hi> wrote this Epiſtle the Word was made fleſh, and had carried that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſſumed of his into Heaven, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Apoſtle ſaith there are but three that bear record in Heaven, <hi>the Father, the Word,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> ſo that the Word with <hi>his own proper fleſh</hi> is <hi>but one and the ſame perſon.</hi> There is a <hi>new perſon</hi> added to the <hi>Trinity</hi> by the <hi>Word's being made fleſh,</hi> as he is ſaid to be, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. But that perſon whom the Scripture calls <hi>the Word,</hi> or the Son of God, I ſay, the <hi>Word</hi> aſſuming humane nature, <hi>is,</hi> and continues to be the <hi>ſecond
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99997:45"/>perſon</hi> of the Trinity; therefore we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it thus: The humane nature in Chriſt ſubſiſts not <hi>of it ſelf,</hi> or <hi>by it ſelf,</hi> neither doth the humane nature conſtitute any <hi>peculiar perſon</hi> by it ſelf; but the humane nature is taken into the unity of the perſon of the <hi>Word,</hi> and ſubſiſts <hi>wholly in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> the <hi>perſon</hi> of the Word, who is the ſecond perſon in Trinity. <hi>The Word</hi> who was a perſon from Eternity, and ſubſiſted in the Divine nature only before the Incarnation, by reaſon of the Incarnation ſubſiſts in both natures, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and humane; ſo that the Word which the humane nature aſſumed, is and remains to be the ſecond perſon in Trinity. Mark, the Word's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of humane nature doth not make him ceaſe to be a perſon in the Trinity, which he was before the Incarnation: That he was a perſon in the Trinity before his Incarnation, is clear from <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. Neither doth the Word's aſſuming of humane nature make an addition of any new perſon to the Trinity; but thus we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it, One and the ſame perſon who ſubſiſted in the Divine nature only before his Incarnation, by means of his Incarnation ſubſiſts in both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: ſo that we may truly ſay, The Word with his proper fleſh, that is, the Word with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature aſſumed, is, and remains to be the ſecond perſon in Trinity. It is a ſpeech which <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath:
<note place="margin">Homine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpto non auctus eſt numerus perſonarum Trinitatis, ſed eadem Trinitas manſit.</note> 
                     <hi>When the nature of man was aſſumed by one of the perſons of the Trinity, the number of the perſons was not increaſed, but the ſame Trinity ſtill remains.</hi> But here we may obſerve the ſingular advancement of our nature, which is all that I aim at in what hath been ſpoken. By what we have heard we may ſee, how by reaſon of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:99997:46"/>Incarnation a part of our nature ſtands in ſo near a relation to the Trinity. The humane nature in Chriſt hath a nearer relation to the Trinity than any creature whatſoever,

It is a ſpeech of <hi>Ambroſe: Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not to be deſpiſed, which is taken into ſo near ſociety and fellowſhip with the holy Trinity.</hi> And it is a great ſpeech of <hi>Luther:</hi> The humanity of Chriſt, although it be a creature, yet becauſe this only and no other creature doth ſo adhere to God, as that it is one perſon with the Divinity, it is higher than all other creatures, and above all other creatures, yet under God alone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Conſideration is this, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of our nature by the work of Chriſts Incarnation appears in this, In that by means of the Incarnation a part of our nature is become the <hi>Temple</hi> as it were of the <hi>Divinity: Deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up; but he ſpake of the Temple of his body, Joh.</hi> 2.21. Here we ſee the body of Chriſt, or the humanity of Chriſt is plainly called a Temple; and whoſe Temple was it? the Temple of the Divinity: <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three days I will raiſe it up.</hi> He that could raiſe up the Temple of his body when it was deſtroyed by death, muſt needs be God; therefore the perſon dwelling in this Temple was God: ſo that Chriſt calls his own humanity, the Temple of his Divinity. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In him dwells all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi> The fulneſs of the Godhead dwells in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt as in its proper ſeat or Temple. It is a ſaying of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">Totum ejus corpus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet tota Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitas.</note> The whole Divinity fills his whole humanity. Yet we muſt take this aright; when we ſay that the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:99997:46"/>of Chriſt is the <hi>Temple of the Divinity,</hi> we muſt not ſuppoſe that the God head is or can be circumſcribed; but thus we ought to conceive it, that by means of the perſonal Union the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head dwells in the humane nature of Chriſt, ſo as it dwells not in any other creature whatſoever. Now what an advancement is this to our nature, that a part of our nature ſhould be as it were the <hi>proper</hi> ſeat and <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Divinity?</hi> That God ſhould manifeſt himſelf in, by, and through our nature aſſumed: that the Divinity ſhould <hi>ſhine</hi> through our nature, and ſhew it ſelf to us by our nature. A notable Scripture to illuſtrate this in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The word was made fleſh,</hi> and what follows? <hi>We beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> The meaning is, we beheld ſome rays and beams of the Divinity breaking forth through that fleſh of his. God was made viſible to us in the perſon of his Son, who had aſſumed a part of our nature. Hence is it, that the body of Chriſt, or the humane nature of Chriſt is called a <hi>Tent</hi> or <hi>Tabernacle, Heb.</hi> 8.2. &amp; 9.11. Why is the body of Chriſt, or the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt called a <hi>Tabernacle?</hi> For this reaſon: Look as the glory of God filled the Tabernacle of old, ſo the glory of the Divinity hath filled his humane nature. The body of Chriſt or his humane nature (as <hi>Calvins</hi> expreſſion is up on that place) <hi>It is that Temple in which the whole Majeſty of God dwells.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt Conſideration to ſhew how our nature is advanced by the Incarnation of the Son of God, is this, By means of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, Chriſt-man</hi> hath <hi>ſupreme Authority, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> over all creatures, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99997:47"/>the <hi>Government</hi> of the World, and the ordering of all the affairs of it are committed to him by the Father. There are clear Texts of Scripture to prove this, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.22, 27. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son. And hath given him authority to execute judgment becauſe he is the Son of man.</hi> Matth. 28.28. <hi>All power and authority is given to me in heaven and in earth.</hi> Pſal. 110.2. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand.</hi> Hence is that ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Eſt haec &amp; fiducia &amp; gloriatio noſtra, quòd noſtrûm ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulorum portio, ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. His <hi>advancement</hi> and <hi>preheminence</hi> above all creatures. God hath given him <hi>a Name above every name, Phil.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It imports his <hi>ſupreme Power, Authority, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> over all creatures. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. &amp; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6. <hi>He hath put all things under his feet.</hi> The <hi>Radix</hi> or root of this Power which Chriſt is ſaid to have over all creatures lyeth <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>originally</hi> in the <hi>Divine nature</hi> of the Son. The Son, the ſecond perſon in Trinity, as he is one and the ſame God with the Father and the Spirit, hath power and dominion over all creatures; and as he is the Son incarnate, as he is made man, ſo he hath all power in a way of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation,</hi> all power is <hi>committed</hi> to him, and he exerciſeth that power <hi>miniſterially</hi> as the Delegate of the Father, which yet is in him originally and eſſentially as he is one God with the Father. Hence is it that Divines obſerve, If the queſtion be asked According to which nature it is that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99997:47"/>Chriſt is ſaid to ſit at the right hand of God? The anſwer muſt be, That it is according to both his natures: for as Chriſt is appointed to be Mediator according to both natures, ſo he is King of the Church according to both natures; only there is this difference to be obſerved, The Divine nature in Chriſt receives nothing <hi>new</hi> which it had not before. When all Power and Authority is ſaid to be given to Chriſt, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature in Chriſt receives nothing new which it had not before: only there is a new manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine power and glory by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as Chriſt prays:
<note place="margin">Joh. 17.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Glorifie me with the glory which I had with thee before the foundation of the world.</hi> As he was the eternal Son, ſo he was poſſeſſed of the ſame glory as the Father had from Eternity: now he prays, that that glory which he had as the Son and as God, might be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in and by the humane nature; therefore we muſt remember, the Divine nature received nothing but only a new <hi>manifeſtation</hi> of the glory it had before, in and by the humane nature aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: but the humane nature is that which hath <hi>properly Power</hi> and <hi>Authority given</hi> to it. Hence is that ſpeech of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>thomo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit quod ut Deus ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebat.</hi> Theodor.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that as he was man which he had always as he was God.</hi> As he was God, he always had Power and Authority inveſted in him, now he received that as man which he had always in him as God. The Son, as he was God, did always reign with the Father before his Incarnation: And hence that ſpeech of Chriſt, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work, Joh.</hi> 5.17. But although the Son did reign before his Incarnation, yet it was then as God, nakedly and ſimply conſidered: as God
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99997:48"/>not as yet cloathed with our fleſh;
<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Before his Incarnation,</hi> ſaith a Learned Divine, <hi>he reigned with the Father as God, nakedly and ſimply conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as cloathed with his eſſential glory; but after his Incarnation he reigned as God cloathed with our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> That is, ſays he, God the Father did not account the Son unworthy of this Honour and Authority, although covered with our vile fleſh, and admitted him as the Son incarnate into a Copartnerſhip with him in his Kingdom, caſting this honour upon the humane nature, becauſe it was joyned to his own Son in perſonal Union. Juſt as if a Kings Son had taken ſome old gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to himſelf and cloathed himſelf therewith, far inferiour to the dignity of that Relation he bears unto his Father, and his Father ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him with thoſe garments to ſit down with him in his Throne: ſo the Son of God, though cloathed with our nature, covered with our fleſh, is not diveſted of his Government; but he, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Father, governs this World. This was that which made one of the Ancients uſe this expreſſion: That he who is God ſhould ſit with God, that he who is the Son ſhould reign with the Father, is no ſuch wonderful thing; for, he that hath the ſameneſs of nature, may well have the ſame power and dominion: but that a part of our nature ſhould have the ſame honour with him that aſſumed it, this is that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all wonder. But when Divines ſay, <hi>whole Chriſt,</hi> that is, Chriſt not only as God, but as man, hath power over all creatures, or the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the perſon of the Son of God, reigns over
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99997:48"/>all creatures, we muſt underſtand this aright. We muſt not ſuppoſe that Chriſt, conſidered as meer man without his Divinity, or that the humanity ſeparate and abſtract from the Divinity, hath this Soveraignty and ſupreme Dominion over all creatures; for ſupreme Power, Dominion, and Soveraignty over all creatures is proper to God only, it is ſuch a Dignity as is proper to God only; therefore is it ſaid <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22. <hi>I am God, and beſide me there is no other:</hi> and what follows? <hi>To me every knee ſhall bow, every tongue ſhall ſwear.</hi> He muſt needs be God, to whom every knee muſt bow, and every tongue muſt confeſs: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not compatible to any creature, ſimply and by it ſelf conſidered, to have dominion over all things. But we ought thus to conceive of it: The humanity of Chriſt is to be lookt upon as an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> that is <hi>conjoyned with the Deity:</hi> the Son of God, becauſe he hath the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture united to him, exerciſes all Rule, Power, and Authority by the humanity, as by an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conjoyned with him: The Power remains in the Divine nature <hi>primarily, radically,</hi> and <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally,</hi> and this Power is exerciſed by the humane nature ſecondarily and miniſterially: that is to ſay, whatſoever Chriſt wills by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, the ſame doth he will by his humane will; whatſoever he doth in the Church as God, he doth it alſo as man. Not that the humane nature is omnipotent, but the perſon who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the humane nature as well as in the Divine is omnipotent, and there is a concourſe of both natures in every action, the perſon working by each nature what is proper to each nature.</p>
                  <p>We come now to make ſome uſe of what hath
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99997:49"/>been opened; there are ſeveral Uſes will ariſe from the Doctrine that hath been delivered.</p>
                  <p>We may learn from what hath propounded, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> that there is a <hi>vaſt difference</hi> between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Believers.</hi> Believers have Union with the Father and the Son; yet the humane nature in Chriſt, or Chriſt as he is man, hath a preheminence above all Believers: and that will appear by reflecting a little upon what hath been ſpoken.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider this: the humane nature in Chriſt hath that relation to the Trinity, that no Believer in the world hath. It is a <hi>Maxime</hi> with Divines. <hi>The humanity of Chriſt belongs perſonally to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Humanitas Chriſti per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonaliter pertinet ad Trinitatem.</note> Now when Divines ſay, That the <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of Chriſt belongs <hi>perſonally</hi> to the Trinity, their meaning is not, that the humanity of Chriſt brings in a new perſon, for then there would be a <hi>Quaternity,</hi> four perſons inſtead of three: but when they ſay, the humanity of Chriſt belongs perſonally to the Trinity, their meaning is, the humanity of Chriſt belongs and hath <hi>relation</hi> unto the <hi>Word,</hi> who is one of the perſons in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and that it ſtands in perſonal Union with him; ſo that the ſecond perſon in Trinity ſubſiſts perſonally in the humane nature aſſumed, which he doth not in any other creature whatſoever. So that none of the Elect hath that kind of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Trinity, which the humane nature in Chriſt hath: for the humane nature in Chriſt doth not ſubſiſt of it ſelf out of the ſecond perſon in Trinity; but the ſecond perſon in Trinity takes the humane nature into the ſubſiſtence of his own perſon; ſo that the humane nature in Chriſt hath that relation to one of the perſons in the Trinity, (to whom in perſon it is united)
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:99997:49"/>and thereby to the whole Trinity, that no other creature, whether Angels or men, ever had or ſhall have.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The humane nature in Chriſt is the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Divinity.</hi> God manifeſts himſelf to us in and by that humanity which the Son hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

<note place="margin">Per natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram quae cernitur, adoretur quae non cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitas.</note> the Divinity which cannot be ſeen may be worſhipped.</hi> We wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God in and by the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt; but this cannot be ſaid of any of the Saints: we cannot worſhip God in and by any of the Saints, as we do in and by the humane nature of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. THE ſeventh Particular, to demonſtrate the greatneſs of the Love of Chriſt in the work of his Incarnation, is this: The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation appears in this, In that by means of the Incarnation of the Son of God, our nature, as it is in the Head of the Church, is reſtored to its ancient purity, integrity, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It is a good obſervation of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Filius Dei naturam noſtram ſibi conjunxit, ut eam in ſe primò &amp; per ſeipſum ad priſtinam pulchritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tueret.</hi> Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril.</note> 
                     <hi>The Son of God hath joyned our nature to himſelf, that firſt of all he might repair our nature in himſelf, and by himſelf reſtore our nature to its ancient beauty.</hi> To underſtand this, we muſt know, that <hi>Adam</hi> had loſt original Righteouſneſs, infected and corrupted mans nature with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion and taint of Original ſin. Now the Son of God by his Incarnation, hath repaired our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and reſtored it to its primitive beauty and perfection. The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> by his Fall left our nature under the contagion of Original ſin; the Son of God in his Incarnation took up our nature without ſin, and as the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> repreſents
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99997:53"/>our nature in himſelf pure and ſpotleſs. <hi>Such an High-Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, ſeparate from ſinners, Heb.</hi> 9.26. So that this is the ſingular priviledge of Believers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be poor ſinful creatures in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, groaning under the body of ſin and death; yet they have this to glory in, that their Head the Lord Jeſus is without ſin, and preſents their nature pure and ſpotleſs before the Throne of God. <hi>In him is no ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. He doth not ſay, In him <hi>was</hi> no ſin; that is true indeed: for in him <hi>was no ſin,</hi> neither <hi>was there any guile found in his mouth.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſaith here, <hi>In him is no ſin:</hi> It is as much as if he ſhould ſay, As Chriſt was without ſin here on Earth, ſo he is without ſin in Heaven, he preſents our nature pure and ſpotleſs before the Throne of God. This is the ſingular priviledge of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they may glory in Chriſt their Head, when they have nothing to glory in of their own. Hence is it, that which the Apoſtle faith, <hi>We glory in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or we <hi>boaſt in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>&amp;c. Phil.</hi> 3.3. as much as to ſay, We do not boaſt in our ſelves, we do not glory in our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but we glory in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt: we glory and boaſt in this, that we have that righteouſneſs and perfection in our Head, which we have not in our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, In that by means of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of God, there is a foundation laid for our acceptance with God: <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi> This is ſpoken of the <hi>Son incarnate,</hi> after he was made man. God the Father delights in the Son <hi>when
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99997:53"/>incarnate.</hi> To underſtand this, we muſt know, as he was the <hi>eternal</hi> Son, the expreſs image of the Fathers perſon, proceeding from the Father by eternal Generation, ſo he was eternally his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. This is clear from <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.30. <hi>I was daily his delight.</hi> Now that which we are farther to conſider is, As the Father delights in the Son, as his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Son, ſo he delights in the Son when incarnate, when made man, he delights in the Son when cloathed with our nature: the eternal Son being the object of his Fathers delight and compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and the Son taking our nature into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Union with himſelf, the love, delight, and complacency of the Father redounds and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows (if I may ſo expreſs it) unto the humane nature aſſumed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son.</hi> And how doth he love him? Not only as the Son ſimply conſidered, but he loves him as the Son incarnate; he loves him as the Son come into our nature, he loves him as he is Mediator. To open this a little further, we may conſider, that the <hi>humane nature,</hi> by means of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of God, hath its <hi>ſtanding</hi> as it were in the <hi>Divine</hi> Perſon: yea, I find how ſome of the Ancients go further.

                     <hi>Damaſcene</hi>'s expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is, <hi>That the humane nature is a part as it were of his perſon.</hi> And a modern <hi>Divine</hi> obſerves, <hi>The humane nature belongs to the integrity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatneſs of the perſon of the Word incarnate.</hi> Yet to prevent all miſtakes, we muſt underſtand this cautiouſly; That perſon whom the Scripture calls the Word, or the Son, which is the ſecond of thoſe three the Scripture ſpeaks of, <hi>(There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Spirit)</hi> was a <hi>Perſon</hi> from <hi>Eternity,</hi> and the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99997:54"/>humane nature is not <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>ſtrictly</hi> a part of his perſon, neither doth it add any thing to the <hi>compleating</hi> of his perſon, <hi>ſimply conſidered:</hi> but on the contrary, the humane nature having no perſonal ſubſiſtence of its own, receives <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality</hi> from the <hi>Word,</hi> or the <hi>Son</hi> of God, who was a perſon from Eternity. Hence is it that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines obſerve, That the perſon of Chriſt in <hi>one reſpect</hi> may be called a Perſon that is ſimple and uncompounded; look upon Chriſt ſimply as the ſecond perſon in Trinity, and ſo his perſon is moſt ſimple and uncompounded, and his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity adds nothing to it: but in <hi>another reſpect,</hi> look upon him as he is Mediator in a way of Diſpenſation, and ſo they ſay Chriſts perſon is a perſon that may be ſaid to be compounded; that is to ſay in plain terms, conſider Chriſt under the notion of Mediator, ſo the humane nature is not to be excluded from the perſon of the Mediator: it is not to be excluded from the conſideration of Chriſt as Mediator. For Chriſt is not Mediator according to one nature meerly: not according to his Divine nature meerly, nor according to his humane nature meerly; but Chriſt, as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, is Mediator according to both natures: and is to be conſidered as Mediator according to both natures.
<note place="margin">Chriſtus eſt ex duabus naturis, &amp; in duabus naturis.</note> Chriſt, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as <hi>conſiſting</hi> of both natures, and as <hi>ſubſiſting</hi> in <hi>both natures.</hi> It is a paſſage of one of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients: <hi>It is a thing of equal danger to believe Chriſt to be God only, without believing him to be man; or to believe him to be man only, without believing him to be God:</hi> for the Mediator is to be believed to be both God and man, the Mediator is both God and man in one perſon. Now to return to what
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99997:54"/>was firſt propoſed. The Mediator being both God and man, the love of the Father extends it ſelf to the <hi>whole perſon</hi> of the Mediator, who is man as well as God, and all the complacency and delight of the Father is taken up in him: ſo that a part of our nature being taken into unity of perſon with the Son of God, there is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid for the Fathers delight and complacency in us. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>He hath made us accepted in the beloved, Eph.</hi> 1.6. Chriſt is <hi>firſt beloved,</hi> and we are beloved in him. The Father hath <hi>a part</hi> of our nature always before him, which is ever in his eye, which ſtands <hi>in perſonal union</hi> and communion with his own Son, and Chriſt man hath no ſin in him, but is perfectly pure and righteous; and being ſo, is perfectly pleaſing and delightful to the Father; and he being Head of the Church, all that are members of his body are looked upon in him, and are accepted in him. To underſtand this more clearly, we muſt conſider, that our nature by ſin is <hi>alienated</hi> and <hi>eſtranged</hi> from God, lyes under wrath and the curſe; but now by the <hi>Incarnation</hi> of the Son of God, our nature is again brought near to God. The Son incarnate and made man is perfectly the object of the Fathers delight, and our nature being repreſented pure and ſpotleſs before the Thone of God in the perſon of the Son of God, the Father reflecting on our nature, as it ſtands in perſonal union and conjunction with his Son, accepts of us and delights in us through his Son: ſo that by means of the Incarnation of the Son of God, there is a foundation laid for our acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance with God.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:99997:55"/>in this, In that by means of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Son of God, <hi>Grace is brought down, depoſited, and lodged as it were in our nature, as in a fountain near at hand, that we may know where to go and have recourſe for all grace.</hi> The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it ſelf is the original ſpring and fountain of all grace: it is proper only to God to create grace; therefore is it we have that expreſſion, <hi>The God of all grace,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. But look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Divinity or Godhead, ſimply or abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, and ſo it is as a ſpring that is more remote, and kept hidden and ſecret from us; but in the Incarnation of the Son of God, God is manifeſted in the fleſh, and ſo the Godhead, which is the Original and head-ſpring of all grace, is brought near unto us: <hi>With thee is the fountain of life, Pſal.</hi> 36.9. Now in Chriſt the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells bodily; therefore the fulneſs of the Godhead dwelling in Chriſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, by neceſſary conſequence the fulneſs of life and grace muſt neceſſarily dwell in Chriſt. The Divine nature empties it ſelf as it were into the humanity of Chriſt, and from God in Chriſt we receive all grace. Hence is it ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word is made fleſh,</hi> and what follows upon that? <hi>full of grace and truth.</hi> Immediately upon the Words <hi>being made fleſh,</hi> the humane nature, which the Word aſſumed, comes to be repleniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>grace and truth.</hi> Obſerve the order or gradation that is here ſet down, firſt the Word, the ſecond perſon in Trinity, aſſumes our nature, <hi>the Word is made fleſh;</hi> what follows upon this? The Word being made fleſh, he having the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in him <hi>fills</hi> the humane nature with all grace. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>The Word is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:99997:55"/>made fleſh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth.</hi> What follows upon this? <hi>Out of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we receive grace for grace.</hi> The Word incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the Word made fleſh, the Son of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming man, he is now the <hi>proximate</hi> and <hi>next fountain</hi> of grace to us. The Godhead of the Son, which is one and the ſame with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Father, is the original fountain of all grace, and the Son in our nature is the proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and next fountain of grace to us; and hence is it that the Ancients call the humanity of Chriſt the <hi>Receptacle</hi> of grace.

To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this we muſt know, that our nature had loſt original righteouſneſs, our nature was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the image of God, was alienated from the life of God, and the way was barred and ſhut up as to our reception of grace; for <hi>our iniquities had ſeparated between God and us,</hi> as the Prophets expreſſion is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.1. The Son of God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his Incarnation hath ſo united the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature to the humane, that he hath brought down and depoſited as it were the whole ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Godhead in the humane nature aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that ſo grace, life, ſalvation, from which we were eſtranged and alienated by ſin, might be brought near to us again; and grace being now depoſited in a part of our nature, from this part of our nature which is taken into perſonal
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99997:56"/>union with the Son of God (which is a nature conſubſtantial with ours, and near akin to us) grace, life, ſalvation might be derived to us, from his fulneſs we might receive grace for grace. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Becauſe the children were made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of fleſh and blood, he alſo took part of the ſame.</hi> Now ſaith the Apoſtle elſewhere, <hi>No man ever as yet hated his own fleſh.</hi> He that is a <hi>brother</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is no grief to him to part with ſome of his ſubſtance, with ſome of the goods he is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, to his own brethren, who are fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone. It is a great Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture yet farther to illuſtrate this: <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf, and hath given him authority to execute judgment becauſe he is the Son of man, Joh.</hi> 5.26, 27. <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves from that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>[becauſe he is the Son of man]</hi> Chriſt was therefore ordained by the Father to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of life, that ſo we might not have life to ſeek afar off: Chriſt received nothing for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as if he needed any thing for himſelf, but he received that wherewith he might inrich us: and the ſum of theſe two verſes he makes to be this, <hi>That is laid open to us in Chriſt man, which did before lye hid in God;</hi> becauſe the Majeſty of God, as it is at a great diſtance from us, is like to a ſpring that lyes hidden and latent,

We have in Chriſt a fountain that is near and ready at hand, and that which lyes open to us, from whence we might receive all grace.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, In that by means of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:99997:56"/>of the Son of God, grace is not only brought near to us, but it is made moſt <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>ſure.</hi> That which a <hi>meer</hi> man received might be taken away and loſt as it was in <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore grace was depoſited in the hands of one who was God as well as man, that ſo grace might be made moſt ſure and firm. The beſt of creatures are muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things and ſubject to change: hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Job</hi> 4.18. <hi>Behold, he puts no truſt in his ſervants, and his Angels he chargeth with folly.</hi> The <hi>Angels</hi> themſelves, which are the higheſt rank of creatures, are ſubject to change: the good Angels who never ſinned, yet might have ſinned and fallen, had they not been confirmed by Divine grace. And that they might have done ſo, it appears plainly by the inſtance of the evil Angels. The evil Angels were created at firſt in the ſame ſtate of dignity and glory as the good Angels were; but they being left to the mutability of their own will, fell from God: whereas the good Angels were confirmed by grace. It is a wiſe ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin: God,</hi>

Now grace in the Head of the Church is laid moſt ſure. The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in Chriſt is an <hi>indeficient, never failing</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of grace. So that the humane nature of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:99997:57"/>Chriſt had not only created habits in it, as <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul had, but the Godhead was perſonally united to it; ſo that unleſs we could ſuppoſe a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Hypoſtatical or perſonal Union, it is impoſſible that the humane nature in Chriſt ſhould ceaſe to be filled with Divine grace. Hence is that expreſſion of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.57. <hi>As the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father.</hi> It is as much as if our Saviour had ſaid, The God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is a living ſpring, a living fountain of grace. It is uſual with Chriſt, when he ſpeaks of thoſe things which belong to the Divine nature which is common to him and the <hi>Father,</hi> to attribute them to the Father; therefore he ſaith, <hi>I live by the Father.</hi> The Father is the firſt perſon in the Deity: and although the Son be poſſeſſed of the ſame Deity, yet when Chriſt ſpeaks of ſuch things as belong to the Deity or the Divine nature, he uſeth the name of the <hi>Father,</hi> in which expreſſion his own Divinity is comprehended. So <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10. <hi>The Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the works:</hi> his meaning is, the <hi>Divine nature.</hi> The Divine nature is common to him and the Father; but he expreſſes it thus, <hi>The Father in me doth the works.</hi> Now ſaith he, <hi>As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father:</hi> his meaning is, the Divinity which is united to my fleſh is a <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Spring</hi> and fountain of grace: my humanity receives all grace, life, and virtue from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity inhabiting in it. The Divine nature in the perſon of the Son holds the humane nature in the neareſt, cloſeſt, and moſt indiſſoluble uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and being ſo nearly and ſtrictly united to the humanity, fills the humanity with all grace. So that the firmneſs and ſureneſs of grace to the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:99997:57"/>Elect depends upon a treble Baſis or foundation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It depends upon the firmneſs and indiſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Union that is between the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It depends upon the <hi>Indeficiency</hi> of grace, and the <hi>inexhauſtible Fulneſs</hi> that is in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It depends upon a Believers Union with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the perſonal Union can never be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, then the humane nature which always abides in the neareſt union with the Divine, muſt always partake of the power, virtue, and efficacy of the Divine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If the ſpring of grace which is in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, do never fail or be dryed up, then the grace in the humane nature, which is always fed and maintained by this ſpring, can never ceaſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Believers ſtanding in union and conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with their Head as members of his body, muſt needs partake of the virtue and influence of their Head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30. &amp; 1.23.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude this particular with a paſſage of one of the Ancients. Thoſe things which a meer man received, might be taken away from him, as they were from <hi>Adam:</hi> that therefore grace and the gifts of God may remain firm; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt, who is God and man, received power as he was man, which he had always as he was God, that his humanity receiving all things, thoſe things might be delivered over to us out of his humanity to be firmly and ſurely poſſeſſed by us.</p>

Man was a glorious creature, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent piece as firſt he came out of the hand of God: but what ruine, what deformity hath ſin brought upon this glorious and excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! Who is there that turns his eyes in and upon himſelf, and hath not cauſe to lament the ſad and miſerable ruines ſin hath made there? The underſtanding is full of darkneſs, the will perverſe, and wholly carried off from God the chief good, the affections wholly bent and ſet upon ſenſible objects, the whole man depraved and out of order, lying under the ſad effects of original ſin. What is it that may comfort us in reference to theſe ruines, and this ſad deformity ſin hath brought, but only the conſideration of the Incarnation of the Son of God? By the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of the Son of God our nature is reſtored to its ancient beauty and perfection: let us turn our eyes upon the Head of the Church, and there we may ſee Holineſs ſhining forth in its greateſt beauty and perfection: there we may ſee our nature without ſin, a mind full of Divine light and knowledge, a will exactly conformed to the Divine will, affections moſt pure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. Now our nature being thus repaired and reſtored to its ancient purity in our Head, we have this aſſurance it ſhall be repaired in us. We have in Chriſt an inſtance what we may expect, if we be his members; for God hath predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us <hi>to be conformed to the image of his Son:</hi> and he is <hi>the firſt-born among many brethren,</hi> Rom. 8.29.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Eph. 3.17.</note> that Chriſt might dwell in their hearts by faith. The more Chriſt dwells in our hearts by faith, the greater ſenſe we ſhall have of our Adoption and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of our perſons. The Son of God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our nature, lays the foundation for our Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and the acceptation of our perſons; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more firmly we embrace the Son of God cloathed with our nature in the arms of our faith, the greater ſenſe we ſhall have of our ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and acceptation. Chriſt is the <hi>natural</hi> Son of God, if we embrace him and adhere to him by faith, the greater evidence ſhall we have that we are the <hi>adopted</hi> ſons of God by faith in him. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> That which makes us ſons at firſt will be the means to continue the <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of this ſonſhip to us. It is faith makes us the ſons of God; therefore if we would have the comfort of our ſonſhip, let us look to this, that Chriſt dwell in our hearts by faith. When Chriſt promiſes to manifeſt the Fathers love to us, how is it that he will do it? He ſaith, <hi>I in them, Joh.</hi> 17.26. Let us conſider it well, the <hi>way</hi> by which Chriſt manifeſts the Fathers love to the Elect, is by his <hi>being</hi> in them.

The reaſon is, becauſe grace is kept ſure and ſafe in the Head of the Church, the fountain of grace, the Lord Jeſus. <hi>Adam</hi> indeed had a ſtock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, but he being a creature, and therefore mutable, did not keep that ſtock com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him: the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Head of the Church, is God as well as man, and grace being depoſited in him, it is now lodged in a ſure hand. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> As much as if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

So that if the Divine power can preſerve the Saints, they ſhall be preſerved to eternal life. Let us labour to be in the number of Chriſts ſheep, ſuch as truly follow him, and he hath undertaken to keep us from periſhing, and to bring us ſafe to eternal life.</p>

                  <p>WE now come yet to ſome other Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the opening of this great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, to ſhew the greatneſs of the Love of Chriſt in the work of his Incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The eleventh Propoſition is this, The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation appears in this, In that by means of the Incarnation of the Son of God, there is a foundation laid for our <hi>Adoption and being made the ſons of God.</hi> It was a ſpeech of <hi>Irenaeus: The Son of God was made the Son of man,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Filius Dei factus eſt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis ad hoc, ut &amp; homo fieret filius Dei.</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus.</note> for this very end, that man might be made the ſon of God. Rom.</hi> 8.29. Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the firſt-born among many brethren. Peter Martyr</hi> obſerves from that expreſſion; So good is God, that when as God had a Son, and ſuch a Son whom he took perfect delight and complacency in, yet he was pleaſed to adopt more ſons of the ſtock of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, among whom Chriſt is the firſt born: and whereas it is ſaid, He was the <hi>firſt-born</hi> among many brethren, this muſt be underſtood in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99997:61"/>of his humane nature aſſumed; for as to the Divine nature, Chriſt is not ſo properly called <hi>Primogenitus</hi> as <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nigenitus, the firſt born</hi> as <hi>the only begotten</hi> Son of the Father. Chriſt is the Head of all the Elect;

                        </gap>.</note> therefore he is ſaid to be <hi>fore-ordained before the foundation of the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20 that is, before the foundation of the world he was ordained to be the Head of the Church.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sicut prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinatus eſt ille unus ut caput no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrum eſſet: ita &amp; mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ſumus praedeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti ut eſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ejus membra.</hi> Aug. <hi>Deus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum ipſum quatenus homo eſt, primum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinavit, in quo caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros ſervaret.</hi>
                     </note> It is <hi>Auſtins</hi> expreſſion: <hi>As Chriſt was that one only who was predeſtinated to be our Head, ſo we being many are predeſtinated to be his members.</hi> Hence is that expreſſion we have <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Having prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Christ.</hi> The <hi>Original</hi> of our Adoption is Gods <hi>Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, having predeſtinated us:</hi> the <hi>foundation</hi> of our Adoption is in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt; having predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt. God did firſt of all predeſtinate Christ himſelf as he was man, that in him he might ſave all the reſt of the Elect.</hi> To underſtand this, we muſt conſider</p>
                  <p>That Chriſt was the natural Son of God, the only begotten Son of God from Eternity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is he ſaid to be the <hi>only begotten Son who is in the boſom of the Father, Joh.</hi> 1.18. Now the natural and only begotten Son of God being pleaſed to aſſume a part of our nature, he is and remains to be the natural Son of God in and with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature aſſumed. Chriſt did not ceaſe to be the natural Son of God by his Incarnation and taking our nature upon him. As he was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Son of God before his Incarnation, ſo he is after his Incarnation. Now the natural Son of God being come into our nature, the humane nature aſſumed is one in perſon with the Son of God, and Chriſt remaining to be the natural Son
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99997:61"/>of God after his aſſumption of our nature, makes way for us to be the adopted ſons of God. The <hi>Civil Lawyers</hi> obſerve, that no one can obtain the Right and Priviledge of Adoption but by leave of him who is the natural ſon. If there be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſon, none can be an adopted ſon without the leave of the natural ſon. Chriſt is the natural Son, and he being come into our nature,

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

They who receive the natural Son by faith, are made adopted Sons. Hence is it ſaid <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the children of God by faith in Chriſt.</hi> It is an excellent expreſſion <hi>Zanchy</hi> hath upon that Text <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us to the adoption of ſons by Jeſus Christ. For this very end did Chriſt aſſume our nature, being made our Brother according to the fleſh, that we having his Spirit given to us, might be made the ſons of God, and the brethren of Chriſt; and for this cauſe is he ſaid to be the firſt-born among many brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. The twelfth Propoſition for the clearing of this Myſtery, and ſhewing the greatneſs of Chriſts love in the work of his Incarnation is this, That by means of the Incarnation of the Son of God, God hath brought himſelf down to us, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred himſelf more facile and eaſie to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and conceived by us, and alſo more ſweet for us to approach to him. We have ſhewed before, how that by means of the Incarnation of the Son of God, grace is brought down to us, lodged in our nature: now we ſhall ſhew, how that by the Incarnation of the Son of God, God himſelf is brought down to us, brought near to us; ſo that we may the better apprehend and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:99997:62"/>conceive of him, and alſo he is made more ſweet for us to approach to him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By means of the Incarnation of the Son of God, God hath brought himſelf down to us, and rendred himſelf more facile and eaſie to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and conceived of by us. If we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God in his <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>abſolute</hi> nature, <hi>God dwells in light inacceſſible,</hi> and of him it is ſaid, <hi>Whom no man ſaw, nor can ſee,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. The naked, ſimple, abſolute Divinity is too bright an object for our weak eyes to look upon; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God who is <hi>inviſible</hi> in himſelf, hath made himſelf <hi>viſible</hi> (as it were) in the perſon of his Son: therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Chriſt is the image of the inviſible God,</hi> Col. 1.15. and <hi>the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the glory of God ſhines in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. In the face of the Son incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate we may ſee and behold all the glory of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the only begotten Son who is in the boſom of the Father he hath revealed him.</hi> It is <hi>Calvins</hi> obſervation, That as Chriſt is the Mediator of Reconciliation, ſo he is the Medium of <hi>Revelation,</hi> he reveals God to us, and by him we come to the knowledge of God. To underſtand this more clearly and diſtinctly, we muſt know,
<note place="margin">Eadem na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis tota &amp; perfecta eſt in ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis perſonis.</note> this is a ſure <hi>Maxime: The ſame nature of the Divinity is whole and perfect in each of the perſons.</hi> The <hi>Godhead</hi> is not <hi>divided, each per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> is <hi>whole God;</hi> therefore doth our Saviour ſay, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.7. <hi>If ye had known me, ye ſhould have known my Father alſo.</hi> When the <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> is known,
<note place="margin">Quaelibet perſona eſt totus Deus.</note> the Divinity of the Father muſt needs be known, there being but one and the ſame Divinity common between them both. Now then when the <hi>Son</hi> of God, the ſecond perſon in
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:99997:62"/>Trinity, aſſumes our nature, the <hi>whole nature</hi> of God is brought down to us in Chriſt, <hi>This is the true God,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.20. <hi>And he that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father, Joh.</hi> 14.9. There is but one and the ſame Divinity common between the Son and the Father; therefore he that ſees and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the Divinity of the Son, doth at the ſame inſtant apprehend and ſee the Divinity of the Father. Now the <hi>humanity of the Son</hi> is the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> by which we come to ſee and apprehend the Divinity of the Son and of the Father. The <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> is not the <hi>Divinity;</hi> yet the humanity is the <hi>Medium</hi> by which we are helped to conceive and apprehend the Divinity: and that is the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father.</hi> That is, (as a Learned man expounds that paſſage) <hi>As my Divinity is ſeen and apprehended by this aſſumed fleſh of mine,
<note place="margin">Sicut mea Divinitas per hanc carnem aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumtam vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detur, ita etiam vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Patris, quae eadem eſt.</note> ſo alſo is the Divinity of the Father apprehended by this aſſumed fleſh of mine, which is one and the ſame Divinity.</hi> Hence is that expreſſion of our Saviours, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.44. <hi>Jeſus cryed and ſaid, He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that ſent me.</hi> Our Saviour lays much ſtreſs upon it, <hi>he crys</hi> and ſaith, as if he would proclaim it to all the world, and would have all the world take notice of it. And what is the truth he proclaims with ſo much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity? <hi>He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that ſent me.</hi> What, <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt, and <hi>not believe</hi> in Chriſt? this is a <hi>ſeeming contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi> But the plain meaning is this, he that believes in me, believes not in me <hi>only,</hi> but he believes on him that ſent me. Our Saviour would have all men take notice of this, That his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and the Divinity of the Father was one and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99997:63"/>the ſame; therefore he ſaith, <hi>He that believes on me, believes not on me, but on him that ſent me.</hi> As much as if he had ſaid, The Father is in me, the Divinity, Power, Majeſty, Eſſence, all the Divine perfections of the Father are found in me, and ye need not ſeek for God any further than in me; therefore he ſaith <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in me.</hi> Our Saviour doth not here inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that there is a double object of faith, as if the Father were <hi>one object</hi> of faith, and he ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for though the Father and the Son be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſons,</hi> yet the <hi>Divinity common</hi> to them both is but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame,</hi> and there is but one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith in both. When therefore he ſays, <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> his meaning is, that we ſhould direct our faith to God <hi>inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> in him, inhabiting in his <hi>humane nature.</hi> It is a great help to faith, that we may conceive of God in and by the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt. The humanity of Chriſt is the <hi>Temple of the Divinity,</hi> as hath been ſhewn heretofore. In this Temple it is we muſt ſeek for God, and here we may find him. In the days of the Old Teſtament the <hi>Ark</hi> of the Covenant was the <hi>Symbol</hi> of Gods preſence, and that external <hi>Symbol</hi> was ſome help to their faith. The people of God in thoſe days directed their prayers to God before the <hi>Ark,</hi> and they worſhipped him that dwelt between the <hi>Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins.</hi> In the days of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Chriſt is our <hi>Ark,</hi> God hath manifeſted himſelf to us in and by the fleſh of his Son; <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. <hi>In him the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells bodily.</hi> It is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a <hi>Learned</hi> man, That one fruit of the Incarnation of the Son of God,
<note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher.</hi>
                     </note> and of the conjunction of the two natures, the Divine and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99997:63"/>humane nature in Chriſt, is this, That <hi>whereas God hath no ſhape comprehenſible, either to the eye of the body or the ſoul, and the mind of man cannot reſt but in a repreſentation of ſomething that his mind and underſtanding can in ſome ſort reach unto; man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering God in the ſecond perſon of the Trinity, who hath taken our nature, whereby God is revealed in the fleſh, hath whereupon to ſtay his mind.</hi> Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins at the humanity of Chriſt, and then by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees climbs up to the Divinity: this is apparent in thoſe words of <hi>Thomas, My Lord and my God, Joh.</hi> 20.28. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>My Lord,</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. By means of the Incarnation, God doth actually give and communicate himſelf to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt (as <hi>Luthers</hi> expreſſion is) is the <hi>covering</hi> as it were of the <hi>Divine</hi> Majeſty.

And that paſſage of the Church in that triumphant Song of hers, is moſt remarkable, to illuſtrate this point, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Behold, God is my ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c.

The faith of the Saints looks to <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> they ſee God in Chriſt doing all for them, and giving himſelf to them. Though God hath ſent his Son to take up the <hi>humanity,</hi> and is pleaſed to make uſe of that <hi>Medium,</hi> yet they ſee it is God himſelf that is the Author of their ſalvation, and that it is God who doth all for them by his Son. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And that paſſage of our Saviour is moſt remarkable to this purpoſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.7. where he

                  <p n="13">13. The thirteenth Propoſition for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this great Myſtery is, the love of Chriſt in his Incarnation is ſeen in this, In that by means of the Incarnation of the Son of God, as God is brought near to us, ſo we are brought near to him: <hi>Christ is the bond of our union unto God.</hi>

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99997:66"/>3. The <hi>myſtical</hi> Union. All theſe three great Unions are held forth to us in this Text.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>eſſential</hi> Union, the Union of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Father</hi> in the <hi>ſelf-ſame Eſſence.</hi> In thoſe words, <hi>In that day you ſhall know I am in my Father:</hi> that is, you ſhall know that I am the <hi>natural</hi> Son of God, and that the Father hath communicated all his perfections unto me by <hi>eternal Generation: Joh.</hi> 16.15. <hi>All that the Father hath is mine.</hi> You ſhall know that I am <hi>in the Father by the unity of the Divine Eſſence.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. There is the Union of the two Natures in Chriſt implied in theſe words, <hi>You ſhall know that you are in me:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Percipietis Divinae meae incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis myſterium.</note> that is, as a Learned man expounds thoſe words, You ſhall perceive the Myſtery of my <hi>Divine Incarnation,</hi> by means of which the humane nature is united to my Divinity, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into unity of perſon with the Son of God, by means of which, you alſo (after a ſort) may be ſaid <hi>to be in me.</hi> To underſtand this, we muſt know, although it be true, that the Son of God aſſumed humane nature, (not the whole maſs or lump of it, but in a certain part and particle of it) and hereupon that part of humane nature which is taken into perſonal union with the Son of God, hath a nearer relation to the Trinity than any creature whatſoever: yet the Son of God aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:99997:66"/>a part of our nature into perſonal union with himſelf, all the Elect being united to Chriſt by faith, are included in Chriſt as Members rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Head, and ſo injoy the benefit of his Incarnation. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For as much as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame.</hi> So that, although the union be <hi>perſonally</hi> made in one part of humane nature, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>part</hi> which was <hi>perſonally</hi> united to the Son of God, yet all the ſeed have benefit by Chriſts Incarnation, and being implanted into Chriſt by faith, are made <hi>members of his body,

If we deſire to be the ſons and daughters of God, we muſt chuſe and cloſe with Chriſt the natural Son of God.

Now we muſt cloſe with the natural Son of God, as ever we deſire to be the adopted ſons of God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. <hi>To as many as received him he gave power to become the ſons of God.</hi> We are by nature children of wrath, children of hell, children of the curſe; and are we contented to abide ſo always? Are we contented always to abide in that condition of diſtance and eſtrangement to God? If you would have God a Father, you muſt get into Chriſt. God out of Chriſt is a ſin revenging God. Let us therefore look well to our faith: <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>We are the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> If our faith be not right, if we have not cloſed with Chriſt in a right manner, we have no evidence that we are the children of God. There is a ſpurious, a baſtard faith, a falſe faith that is not a true faith: there is a meer hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical faith, which is a conſenting that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is true: there is a temporary faith, when there are ſome flaſhes and pangs of affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt: but then there is the <hi>faith of Gods Elect,</hi> let us look after this.

The way for us to conceive of God, is for us to conceive of God in Chriſt. The Saints of God do find it a difficult thing to conceive of God, to have right thoughts and conceptions of God. Now would you know how to conceive of God, O learn to conceive of God in Chriſt. God is at ſo great a diſtance from us, that if we ſet our ſelves to think or conceive of him in his naked, abſolute, ſimple nature, our thoughts would ſoon loſe themſelves, or elſe be overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the greatneſs of his Majeſty. So true is that ſaying:
<note place="margin">Scrutator Majeſtatis opprimetur à gloria.</note> 
                     <hi>He that thinks to dive into the Abyſs of the Divinity, will ſoon find himſelf overwhelmed with the Divine glory.</hi> The Lord hath ſaid, <hi>No man can ſee his face and live.</hi> We cannot behold the Sun in the Firmament, in its <hi>noon-day glory:</hi> we can much better behold the Sun in a cloud, than behold it in its ſimple glory: ſo God hath veiled his glory in the fleſh of his Son, and the way for us to behold God, is to contemplate God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt. It is far more eaſie for us to conceive of the humane nature in
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:99997:68"/>the perſon of Chriſt, than to conceive of the naked, ſimple, and abſolute Divinity. When we conceive of the humane nature in the perſon of Chriſt, the mind hath ſomething to reſt and ſtay it ſelf upon, and by the humanity we climb up by degrees to the Divinity. It is true, faith ought not to terminate it ſelf in the humanity, but by the humanity we ought to climb and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend up to the Divinity. <hi>By him we believe in God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21.

                  <p n="14">14. The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation is ſeen in this, In that Chriſt becoming true man, and wearing a part of our nature, the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his humanity may be a <hi>great help</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> to our faith to aſſure us of his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion</hi> and <hi>readineſs</hi> to ſupply us in all our wants, and alſo to ſympathize, pity, and compaſſionate us in all our afflictions. Hence it is, that one of the <hi>Ancients</hi> brings in Chriſt ſpeaking thus:
<note place="margin">Ego corpus illorum ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto.</note> 
                     <hi>I do wear their body, and carry about with me a part of their fleſh.</hi> Chriſt wears as it were the fleſh of the Elect, <hi>Now no man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth it and cheriſheth it as the Lord the Church, Eph.</hi> 5.29. That common humanity wherein Chriſt ſhares with us, cannot but incline him to be moſt kind, ſweet, benign to his own kindred
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:99997:70"/>who participate of the ſame nature with him. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the children were made partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo took part of the ſame, Heb.</hi> 2.16. Chriſt was <hi>a man of ſorrows,</hi> therefore he knows how to pity us in our <hi>ſorrows;</hi> Chriſt was <hi>deſerted,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he knows how to pity us in our <hi>deſertion:</hi> Chriſt was <hi>tempted in all points like to us (ſin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)</hi> therefore he knows how <hi>to ſuccour us in our temptations.</hi> Chriſt in the humane nature aſſumed hath felt the ſame <hi>miſeries</hi> and <hi>afflictions</hi> that we are ſubject unto, and therefore he knows experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally (by what he himſelf hath felt and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) how to pity us. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſets this down as one great fruit of the Incarnation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Becauſe the children were made partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo took part of the ſame.</hi> What is the fruit and advantage of this? Why was it that Chriſt took a part of our nature? The next verſe tells us, It was that he might <hi>be a merciful and a faithful High-Prieſt. Calvin</hi> obſerves upon this Text, When all ſorts of miſeries do oppreſs us, we ought to remember there is nothing befals us, which the Son of God hath not experienced in himſelf, neither ought we to doubt, but he is ſo preſent with us to help and pity us, as if he himſelf were afflicted with us. The experience of our miſeries doth ſo bend and incline Chriſt to compaſſion, that he is exceeding ſolicitous of obtaining help from God for us. Hence is it ſaid in the laſt verſe, <hi>For in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi> Chriſt having been exerciſed with the ſame miſeries and afflictions that we are, is moſt propenſe and ready to afford help and relief to us. Chriſt now he is in Heaven, hath not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:99997:71"/>his own ſorrows and ſufferings here on earth, and the remembrance of his own ſufferings cannot but incline him to pity and compaſſionate his people (who are a part of his own nature) in the like ſufferings. It is true, Chriſt as he is God, wants no love, neither needed Chriſt to have known what ſufferings and afflictions were, <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,</hi> to have inclined him to a merciful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for <hi>God is love.</hi> God is ſo in his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and it was the love that was in the Divine nature, that inclined him to aſſume our nature: but becauſe we could not be otherwiſe perſwaded that there was ſo much kindneſs in his heart; therefore in condeſcenſion to our infirmity, and for the ſtrengthening of our faith, Chriſt would become man and taſte of ſufferings and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that having done ſo, we might be the better aſſured he would be the more ready to pity and help us. True indeed, God is <hi>love in himſelf,</hi> his name is the Lord, <hi>gracious, merciful, long-ſuffering, pardoning iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin;</hi> but God being at ſuch a diſtance from us, and alſo a God of ſuch <hi>infinite Purity</hi> and <hi>Majeſty,</hi> we are apt to doubt, whether God will take any notice of ſuch vile and ſinful worms as we are: therefore in a way of <hi>condeſcenſion</hi> God is <hi>come down into our nature,</hi> that ſo faith may have the greater incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, that ſince God dwells in the nature of man, he will not ſhut up his own bowels againſt them who are his own brethren and kindred. Chriſt is <hi>akin</hi> to us, <hi>nearly allied</hi> to us in reſpect of his humanity, one in nature with us in reſpect of his humanity: as he is nearly allied to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and one in nature with him in reſpect of his Divinity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11. The Apoſtle here
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99997:71"/>ſpeaks of Chriſt and his Members, <hi>He that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifies, and they that are ſanctified are of one;</hi> that is, they are <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame nature,</hi> of one and the ſame common nature. We may well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that part of our nature which Chriſt wears, will put him in mind to be kind to us, if he were not otherwiſe inclined unto us. There is a common Law of humanity which commands ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in all men, even in thoſe who are moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate by ſin: the Law of common humanity will force ſome bowels from the worſt of men to them that are in great diſtreſs. How pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful then is this Law, where the force of it is not abated by any allay from ſin, but where this Law is heightned and elevated by the greateſt meaſures of grace, and the preſence of the Divinity inhabiting in the humanity? Thus it is in Chriſt, Chriſt hath the greateſt perfection of grace in him, and the preſence of the Divinity inhabiting in his humanity. Hence it is our Saviour comforts the hearts of his Diſciples upon this account, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> It is as much as if he ſhould ſay, You take this for granted, this is a confeſſed Principle among you, you ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God; now <hi>you believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> Our Saviours meaning is this, Look upon God come down into a part of your nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold God in my humanity, <hi>Ye believe in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in me.</hi> Faith in Chriſt is no prejudice to faith in God the Father; at the ſame time we believe in Chriſt we believe in God the Father: for the Divine Eſſence is one and the ſame in all the three perſons; at the ſame time we believe in the Son, we believe in the Father. Now our
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99997:72"/>Saviour, to incourage us to believe, would have us to behold God in the glaſs of his humanity: <hi>You believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, I that am now ſpeaking to you, am <hi>God and man</hi> in one perſon: you cannot think that I your <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with you ſo long, and of whoſe tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and compaſſion you have had ſo much expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, ſhould want any bowels or tenderneſs in me to do you good: now I am God as well as man; if you think I am inclined to pity you as I amman, I want no power to help and relieve you as I am God.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation is ſeen in this, In that by means of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> there is a foundation laid for the work of his <hi>Mediatorſhip</hi> in general, and alſo for executing thoſe three great Offices of <hi>Prophet, Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>King</hi> in particular. My deſign is not at preſent to treat of Chriſts Mediatorſhip at large, nor to ſpeak largely of his Offices, but only to ſhew how Chriſts <hi>Incarnation,</hi> or his taking of our nature, lays the <hi>foundation</hi> for his undertaking the work of Mediatorſhip in general, and alſo of executing thoſe three great Offices in particular of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt, and King: and alſo to ſhew how his love is demonſtrated to us in this. (1) Chriſts undertaking the Office of Mediatorſhip is the great demonſtration of his love to us; for Chriſt as Mediator brings us back to God, we were at variance with God: now we being at a diſtance from God, and at enmity with him by reaſon of ſin, there was need of a Mediator to reconcile the difference, and bring God and us together. Now here was the great demonſtration of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99997:72"/>love of Chriſt, that the Son of God would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Office of <hi>Mediator,</hi> and that he might do ſo, he was willing to take up our nature in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, that he might perform the Office of Mediator in it. Hence is that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and man, the man Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The Apoſtles intention in uſing this expreſſion <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> is not to exclude the <hi>Divine</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the perſon of the <hi>Mediator;</hi> for it is here obſerved by <hi>Calvin,</hi> when the Apoſtle calls him <hi>Man,</hi> he doth not hereby deny him to be <hi>God;</hi> for this is a ſure Rule in Divinity, <hi>The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Mediator accompliſheth the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption according to both natures, ſo that the work of Redemption is the work of the perſon working in both natures that which is proper to each nature.</hi> Hence is it, that a Judicious Divine obſerves, By a wonderful temperament it is ſo ordered, that the Hypoſtatical union of the two natures is made in the perſon of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t eſſet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatrix hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinitas &amp; Divina hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitas.</hi> Auguſt.</note> 
                     <hi>that he who is our Mediator ſhould be Man-God, and God-man;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought thus to conceive of it: Chriſt took up our nature, that he might perform the Office of Mediator in it; and this is expreſſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5. <hi>When he cometh into the world he ſaith, Sacrifices and burnt-offerings thou wouldst not, but a body haſt thou prepared me. [When he comes into the world.]</hi> Chriſt came into the world by his Incarnation, by his Aſſumption and taking up of our nature; and wherefore did he come into the world? It was to perform the Office of a Mediator, to reconcile us to God, to offer up the great Sacrifice for ſin. Other Sacrifices would not ſerve the turn; and therefore the Son of God
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99997:73"/>would offer the great and true Sacrifice, namely, the Sacrifice of himſelf, and by this means recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God. Now what muſt Chriſt do that he may perform the Office of Mediator and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to God? He muſt take a true humane body. <hi>Sacrifices and burnt-offerings thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me.</hi> The Son of God muſt aſſume <hi>mans nature,</hi> if he will be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator between God and man. It is the office of a Mediator to conjoyn and unite thoſe, between whom he is a Mediator. The extremes are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſome middle, and he that is Mediator had need to have ſome intereſt in both parties to be reconciled: Chriſt therefore being to reconcile us to God and to unite us to him, that he might be a fit Mediator, takes upon him the nature of man, that ſo being God and man <hi>in one perſon,</hi> and having intereſt in both parties, he might bring God and man together. Hence is it, that the Mediator hath this appellation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> given to him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.17. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you is born this day a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Chriſt (you know) ſignifies the <hi>anointed.</hi> Under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets were wont to be <hi>anointed.</hi> Now Chriſt being to undertake the office of Mediator in general, and thoſe three Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in particular of Prophet, Prieſt, and King, he alſo is <hi>anointed.</hi> Chriſts <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> or <hi>Anointing</hi> properly belongs to his humane nature: <hi>Act.</hi> 10.38. <hi>God anointed Jeſus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> For although it be true, that <hi>Chriſt is the name of the perſon ſubſiſting in both natures,</hi> and the name of Chriſt doth not only agree to Chriſt as <hi>he is man,</hi> but as he is <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh:</hi> yet Chriſts <hi>anointing</hi> properly reſpects his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:99997:73"/>nature. As God, he needed not any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing, for he had all fulneſs in himſelf; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was properly anointed as man. If it be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what this anointing of Chriſt was, I anſwer, It is that <hi>plenitude</hi> and <hi>fulneſs</hi> of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; yea, the fulneſs of the Godhead which dwells perſonally in the humane nature aſſumed, whereby he is qualified to perform the office of Mediator. Chriſt being to undertake the <hi>Office of Mediator,</hi> hath his humanity filled with all habitual grace, and alſo the preſence of the Divinity inhabiting perſonally in his humane nature. So that Chriſts aſſumption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, anointing it with the Spirit of all grace, lays the foundation for the great work of his Mediatorſhip. It is well obſerved by a Judicious Divine: <hi>That we may more firmly believe,
<note place="margin">Chemnitius</note> that the benefit of Redemption doth belong to us, therefore did the Son of God aſſume a nature that was of the ſame ſubſtance with ours, and near akin with us, by which (in the virtue of the Divinity) he might accompliſh our Redemption: that as by humane nature in</hi> Adam <hi>ſin and death entred into the world; ſo by the ſame nature in Chriſt, righteouſneſs and life might be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the Incarnation of Chriſt lays the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and prepares the way to the work of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorſhip in general; ſo by the Incarnation Chriſt is fitted and prepared, as it were, to enter upon the execution of thoſe three great Offices of his, the Office of a Prophet, Prieſt, and King.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lord Jeſus aſſuming mans nature, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the office of a Prophet to the Church in the humane nature aſſumed. The great work of the Prophets of old was to be the Meſſengers of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:99997:74"/>God to the people, the Interpreters of Gods mind and will, they were to reveal Gods mind and will to the people. The Lord Jeſus under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking our nature, is the great <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> the Interpreter of the Fathers counſels, he hath revealed the whole will and mind of the Father to us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. <hi>God hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</hi> Joh. 15.15. <hi>All things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known unto you.</hi> Should God ſpeak to us imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Heaven, we ſhould be affrighted at his preſence, and terrified with his Majeſty, as they were when they heard God ſpeaking to them from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Let not God ſpeak to us, but let Moſes ſpeak to us, Exod.</hi> 20.19. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the Son of God aſſumed our nature and appeared viſibly in fleſh, and converſed among men like one of us, that we might receive the Law at his mouth. The humanity of Chriſt is the Organ of the Divinity. And this is one great commendation of the office of the Miniſtry, as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> hath obſerved: That the Son of God, who was God over all bleſſed for ever, was pleaſed to take up humane nature, that he might perform the office of a Miniſter in it. Therefore is Chriſt called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.8. <hi>A Miniſter of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi> that is, to the Jewiſh Church. There is ſome Controverſie among <hi>Divines</hi> concerning the knowledge that was in the humane ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt; but this is certain, Chriſt as man had all things made known to him, that did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſalvation: now whatſoever the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus as man received from the Father, that (as the great Prophet of the Church) he hath faithfully revealed to his people. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.8. <hi>I have given
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99997:74"/>unto them the words which thou gaveſt me.</hi> Chriſt as man receives all from the Father, and he gives out all to the Church. Thus his Incarnation prepares him for the execution of his Prophetical Office.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Son of God by aſſuming mans nature, is prepared for the execution of his Prieſtly Office. Two great works were incumbent on the Prieſts under the Law. 1. To <hi>offer Sacrifices,</hi> and make <hi>atonement</hi> for the people. 2. To <hi>intercede</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for the people. 1. One Office of the Prieſt was to offer Sacrifice and make atonement. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Every High-Prieſt is ordained to offer gifts and ſacrifices.</hi> 2. Another office of the Prieſt was to pray for the people. Therefore ſaith <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, God forbid that I ſhould ceaſe to pray for you.</hi> Now the Son of God, by aſſuming our nature, is qualified to perform both theſe works of a Prieſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt by his Incarnation is fitted to offer Sacrifice. God took no delight in the Sacrifices of beaſts and cattle: <hi>Sacrifices and burnt-offerings thou wouldſt not;</hi> therefore did the Son of God take a true humane body, and offered himſelf for a Sacrifice. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himſelf.</hi> Chriſt is <hi>Prieſt, Altar,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that is <hi>offered:</hi> ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Chriſt was offered to bear the ſin of many.</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>name of the perſon ſubſiſting in both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> ſo that there is a concourſe of both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Divine and humane nature in the work of <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> The <hi>humane</hi> nature was the <hi>nature ſuffering,</hi> and the <hi>Divine</hi> nature that <hi>ſanctified</hi> the ſufferings of the humanity. The <hi>Divinity</hi> was in the <hi>humanity</hi> in the time of its offering: that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:99997:75"/>which hung upon the Croſs, which ſuffered and dyed, was the body of him who was God; it was filled and repleniſhed with God, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head did perſonally inhabit in it, in the time of its ſuffering. Although the Godhead did not put forth its operation as it might have done, but did <hi>reſt</hi> and ſuſpend its operations for a time,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> that it might give liberty to the humane nature to ſuffer, (for if the Godhead ſhould have put forth its operation as it might, it could have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all paſſion and ſuffering in the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) yet the perſonal union always remained; the Son of God did always retain and keep the humane nature in the bond of perſonal union in the height of his ſufferings, and he corroborated and ſtrengthened the humane nature in ſuffering; ſo that as the Apoſtle ſaith, it was <hi>Chriſt that was offered.</hi> There was a concourſe of both natures in his Satisfaction. If he were not man, he could not have ſuffered; and if he were not God, he could not have ſatisfied. Chriſt is a <hi>Prieſt</hi> in our nature: and as the High-Prieſt under the Law bare all the names of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon his Breaſt-plate, ſo Chriſt bears all the names of the Elect upon him. Chriſt ſuſtains the perſons of all the Elect: <hi>Becauſe the children were made partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo took part of the ſame.</hi> Chriſt aſſuming the nature of man, ſuſtains the perſons of all the Elect, and in their room, and in their ſtead, in a part of their nature, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf to God, and taking their guilt upon him, is willing to bear the puniſhment due to them: therefore he ſuffers and dyes in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and remains under the power of death for a time.</p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:99997:75"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt by his Incarnation is fitted for the work of his Interceſſion. As it was the work of the Prieſt to offer Sacrifice and make atonement, ſo to intercede and pray for the people. Now Chriſt by taking our nature is fit for this work alſo. Chriſt as to his Divine nature is equal with the Father, and ſo is the object of prayer together with the Father; but Chriſt according to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature is inferiour to the Father, and ſo fit to intercede. And therefore it is a common ſaying among Divines: <hi>Chriſt intercedes and prays as he is man and Mediator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt by aſſuming our nature performs the Office of a King to the Church. Chriſt hath a natural Kingdom, and he hath a diſpenſatory Kingdom. As he is God, ſo he hath a natural Kingdom over all creatures. <hi>Thy kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and thy dominion is an everlaſting dominion.</hi> As he is God-man, ſo he hath a Kingdom by way of donation and diſpenſation. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion,</hi> Pſal. 2.6. <hi>The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Son, Joh.</hi> 5.22. that is, to the <hi>Son in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate.</hi> Chriſt as Head and King of the Church diſpenſeth all grace to the Church, rules and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns the Church in and by the humane nature aſſumed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.21, 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we ſhewn how that Chriſt by the work of his Incarnation, lays the foundation for the work of Mediatorſhip in general, and for the executing of thoſe three great Offices of Prophet, Prieſt, and King in particular.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The love of Chriſt in his Incarnation is ſeen in this, In that by means of Chriſts Incarnation, our nature which was alienated from God, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99997:76"/>of communion with him, lay under the curſe, was ſubject to all ſorts of miſeries and unto death it ſelf, is now reſtored to communion with God again, delivered from the curſe, ſet above all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and death, cloathed with immortality, and poſſeſſed of perfect happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Son of God by his Incarnation hath reſtored our nature unto communion with God. <hi>Adam</hi> by his Fall was turned out of Paradiſe, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the preſence of God, loſt his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God. Now the Son of God taking a part of our nature into unity of perſon with himſelf, hath brought our nature near to God again, our nature in Chriſt is admitted to the ſight of God and communion with him.

Now the Saints in Heaven are admitted to a clear ſight and viſion of God; therefore if Chriſt had more grace given to him from the beginning than the Saints in Heaven, we muſt ſuppoſe Chriſt had a clear ſight and viſion of God: beſides, the great demonſtration of Chriſts love in his ſufferings was, that he was content to be deprived of the ſight and comfort of his Fathers love; therefore he crys out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me?</hi> This argues, Chriſt had been uſed and accuſtomed to the ſight of his Fathers face and countenance, otherwiſe why did he cry out, <hi>Why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> But for our ſakes he was
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99997:76"/>content to have his Fathers face hid from him for a time, that it might not be hid from us for ever. Now then Chriſt in his humane nature being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the ſight of God, all the Elect in their meaſure ſhall have a ſhare in this priviledge.
<note place="margin">Scientia viſionis competit Chriſto ut capiti, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis ut mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris.</note> The knowledge of viſion is firſt given to Chriſt as the Head, to the Elect as Members: and although all the Elect be not as yet admitted to the viſion of God, yet it is certain they ſhall be as Chriſt now is: <hi>When he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. and in the mean time, <hi>our life is hid with Chriſt in God, Col.</hi> 3.3. hid as in the fountain, root,
<note place="margin">Tanquam in fonte, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipio.</note> and principle of that life. Chriſt in his humane nature being admitted unto the ſight of God and communion with him, is an argument all the Elect alſo ſhall be brought to the ſame happineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Son of God by his Incarnation hath delivered our nature from the <hi>Curſe,</hi> ſet it above <hi>miſery, ſorrow,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> and cloathed it with immortality. The ſentence pronounced concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man, was, That in caſe he ſinned, he ſhould dye the death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. Chriſt by taking our nature, and dying in it, hath born the ſubſtance of that curſe. The curſe comprehended two things in it. Firſt, natural death, the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body. Secondly, ſpiritual death, the ſeparation of the ſoul from God. Here lay the ſting of the curſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> or, <hi>In dying thou ſhalt dye;</hi> thou ſhalt not dye once only, but dye twice as it were, thy ſoul ſhall not only be ſeparated from thy body, but both body and ſoul ſhall be ſeparated from me. Now Chriſt under-went both parts of the curſe, if rightly underſtood. Firſt, Chriſt in a right ſenſe endured
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99997:77"/>that part of the curſe which conſiſted in a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God; for although the <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> was <hi>never</hi> diſſolved; neither was Chriſts humane ſoul ever ſeparated in love or affection from his Father, his ſoul clave in love and affection to his Father in the midſt of all his ſufferings (Chriſt did not undergo ſeparation from God in either of thoſe reſpects) yet his humane ſoul was ſeparated for a time from the <hi>light</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of his Fathers love; as was hinted before, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> He was deprived of the ſenſe and comfort of his Fathers love. Secondly, Chriſt ſuffered natural death, his humane ſoul was truly ſeparated from his body. Now Chriſt having ſatisfied that Law, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt, thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi> by ſuffering the penalty of that Law, hath fully delivered his people from the curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made a curſe for us.</hi> A Learned man obſerves, Becauſe (according to the ſentence of the Divine Judgment) in that day <hi>Adam</hi> fell and ſinned, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature ought to have been puniſhed with eternal perdition: therefore the Son of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to aſſume humane nature, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards did aſſume it, that ſo man might not dye the death. And the ſame Learned man hath another expreſſion to the ſame purpoſe: Becauſe humane nature was depraved and loſt, ſo that it became the body of ſin and death; therefore the Son of God in lieu thereof, was pleaſed in the humane nature aſſumed to condemn ſin, and aboliſh death, and in his own perſon reſtore hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature to righteouſneſs, life, and happineſs. <hi>Chriſt having dyed for ſin once, dyeth no more, death
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99997:77"/>hath no more dominion over him, Rom.</hi> 6.9, 10. Our nature, as it is in Chriſt, it is above death, and the fear of death. O let us think of theſe things, theſe things are the moſt ſolid grounds of comfort. Our nature in Chriſt is above death and the fear of death, it is poſſeſſed of life and immortality, and brought to perfect happineſs. Hence is that expreſſion, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Chriſt who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> Chriſt hath already brought life and immortality into our nature: Chriſt doth already ſtand poſſeſſed of immortality in his own perſon. And this is the ſingular comfort of Believers, that they may ſee a part of their own nature ſet above ſorrow, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and death, and brought to the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs they can wiſh or long for, and that they may be aſſured they ſhall be poſſeſſed of the ſame happineſs in their meaſure which Chriſt their Head is poſſeſſed of. This Chriſt aſſures them of, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.22. <hi>The glory which thou haſt given me I have given them.</hi> Chriſt had glory with the Father from Eternity as he was his <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>coeſſential</hi> Son: this he ſpeaks of <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>Glorifie me with thy ſelf with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> Now beſides this, there is a glory which is <hi>given</hi> to him, <hi>the glory which thou gaveſt me I have given them.</hi> Chriſt had a glory <hi>given</hi> to him as <hi>man</hi> and <hi>Mediator.</hi> Now the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which was given to Chriſt as man and Head of the Church is given to the Elect; ſo that all the Elect do <hi>participate</hi> and <hi>ſhare</hi> in it in their meaſure. <hi>The glory which thou haſt given me I have given them. Calvin</hi> obſerves upon that Text: <hi>The Samplar or pattern of perfect happineſs is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99997:78"/>and ſet forth in Chriſt, that nothing is confined to Chriſt only; but Christ was therefore inriched, that he might inrich Believers, the glory which thou haſt given me I have given them.</hi> Chriſt and his Members ſhare in glory in common, only reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the difference between Head and Members; Chriſt hath the glory of the Head, Believers have glory as Members. Chriſts glorification is the ſureſt pledge of our <hi>glorification;</hi> for how is it poſſible, that he who is our Head, and is now in glory with the Father, ſhould leave us to thoſe miſeries we are now obnoxious to, whenas we are ſo nearly related to him, we being <hi>members of his body, of his fleſh and of his bones? Eph.</hi> 5.30. and he that is <hi>joyned to the Lord is one Spirit.</hi> The Church being ſo nearly related to Chriſt, and Chriſt being in glory, how is it poſſible Chriſt ſhould leave them under thoſe miſeries they are now ſubject unto?</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The greatneſs of Chriſts love in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation appears in this, In that by means of the Incarnation all the Elect ſhall have a ſtanding Monument before their eyes, wherein they may ſee and behold the infiniteneſs and tranſcendency of the love of God to all Eternity. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Propoſition is this, Becauſe the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical or perſonal Union ſhall not be diſſolved in Heaven, the humane nature ſhall remain and abide united to the Divinity to all Eternity. As in Heaven we ſhall be admitted to the ſight of God, we ſhall ſee the Unity in Trinity, and the Trinity in Unity, we ſhall ſee the Unity of the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> and the three perſons, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſubſiſting in this one Eſſence of God: ſo in Heaven we ſhall ſee the great Myſtery of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99997:78"/>perſonal Union, the Myſtery of the two Natures in the perſon of Chriſt more than now we can. And this will be one part of the happineſs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that we ſhall ſee our nature united to the Divinity in the perſon of the Son of God, and by this means we ſhall come to underſtand the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the love of God by ſeeing how <hi>near our nature</hi> is taken unto God in the <hi>perſon</hi> of our <hi>Head.</hi> The Hypoſtatical or perſonal Union is the foundation of the myſtical Union, <hi>viz.</hi> of our union and communion with God: God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a part of our nature into perſonal union with himſelf, and by means of this we have union and communion with him. Now in Heaven we ſhall have a clear ſight what that glory is which Chriſt our Head is advanced unto by the perſonal union. And this I take to be carried in that great Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> The hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of Heaven will be to <hi>gaze</hi> upon the glory of Chriſt, as a Learned Divine expreſſeth it, <hi>That they may behold my glory:</hi> as if ſo be this would be Heaven enough for the Elect to ſee the glory their Head is poſſeſſed of. And what glory is this? <hi>That they may behold my glory,</hi> certainly the glory of his Divinity. Chriſt had <hi>glory with the Father</hi> before the foundation of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.5. <hi>He was in the form of God,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: now all the Elect ſhall ſee and behold his glory, that is, they ſhall ſee the glory of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity: and how ſo? They ſhall ſee and behold the glory of his Divinity ſhining forth <hi>through</hi> his humanity. The humane nature is united to the Divinity in the perſon of the Son; now the Elect
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99997:79"/>in Heaven ſhall ſee that perſon who hath aſſumed their nature to be true God, and to have all the glory of the Divinity in him. As the ſecond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Trinity is true God, and hath all the glory of the Divinity in him; ſo the Elect in Heaven ſhall ſee the humane nature united to the Divinity in the perſon of the Son. Therefore is it added in the cloſe of the verſe, <hi>For thou haſt loved me before the foundation of the world.</hi> Let us take heed how we miſtake here, the <hi>Love</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not the cauſe of the Divinity of the Son: although the Son be begotten of the Father, yet the Generation of the Son proceeds not from an act of Gods will; the Father did not <hi>first love</hi> the Son, and <hi>then</hi> beget him, but the <hi>Generation</hi> of the Son was <hi>natural:</hi> the Father begets the Son from Eternity, and cannot but beget him; God doth <hi>neceſſarily</hi> underſtand himſelf, therefore his <hi>eternal Son</hi> is his <hi>natural Image.</hi> Therefore in this laſt clauſe, <hi>For thou haſt loved me before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of himſelf as man; the humanity of Chriſt was beloved of the Father, from Eternity, above every creature: that humanity of his was ſo choſen and beloved above all creatures, as to be united to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Now in Heaven the Elect ſhall ſee that Chriſt is in the poſſeſſion of that which he was elected and choſen unto from Eternity. And this will be one ſingular demonſtration of the love of God to them, that they ſhall ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves taken ſo near to God in the <hi>perſon</hi> of their <hi>Head.</hi> For although it be true, there will always remain a vaſt difference between Chriſt the Head and the Elect that are Members to him (none of the Elect have, or can have that perſonal union
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99997:79"/>which his humanity hath to the Divinity) yet all the Elect <hi>in the glory</hi> of their Head ſhall ſee and behold the greatneſs of the love of God to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for it was for their ſakes he took part of their nature into <hi>perſonal</hi> union; and a part of their nature being united to God, all the Elect are confirmed in their Head, and by means of their Head are brought into the neareſt commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God they are capable of. So that I ſay, this will be matter of wonder to the Elect to Eternity, to ſee a part of their nature placed ſo near to the Divinity, yea to ſee a part of their nature ſo intimately united to the Divinity in the bond of perſonal union, and to become the ſeat and Temple of the Divinity to all Eternity.</p>

From all that hath been ſaid, let us learn to admire and adore the infinite and tranſcendant love of Chriſt in his Incarnation. Here may we cry out with the Apoſtle, <hi>O the heights, and lengths, and depths, and breadths</hi> that are in the love of Chriſt in his Incarnation! I have ſhewn you in ſeventeen Propoſitions how great the love of Chriſt is in the work of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; and when we have dived never ſo much into this Myſtery, it is but little that we do underſtand of the glory of it in compariſon of what it is in it ſelf. O ſtudy more this great work of the Incarnation of the Son of God: this is the greateſt of all the works of God, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt work that ever he hath done, or that ever he will do. The Incarnation of the Son of God is more than the glorification of all the Saints in Heaven. O therefore ſtudy this Myſtery; the more we ſtudy it, the more will our hearts be
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99997:80"/>raviſhed with it, and the reaſon why we are no more affected with it, is, becauſe we know and underſtand ſo little of it. And let us not only labour to underſtand the greatneſs of the thing it ſelf, but alſo of what importance this work of the Incarnation of the Son of God, is, to our ſalvation. The work of the Incarnation is that which hath laid the foundation of the whole work of Redemption. The Son of God therefore took our nature and became true man, that he might tranſact the buſineſs of our Salvation in the humane nature aſſumed.

                  <p>Now to ſhew what theſe dimenſions of Chriſts love were, I propounded to ſpeak to three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew the Properties of Chriſts Love.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew that this love of Chriſt is ſurpaſſing great, as it is to be found in both his Natures, in his humane and in his Divine nature. And here we conſidered the love of Chriſt diſtinctly: the love that was found in his humane nature, and in his Divine nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſhew that the love of Chriſt is ſurpaſſing great, if we conſider the great and eminent effects of his love.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt great effect of Chriſts love, which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:99997:81"/>hath been inſtanced in, and already finiſhed is this, the work of his <hi>Incarnation.</hi> That the Son of God, who was God by <hi>Nature,</hi> and had his <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> as the ſecond perſon in <hi>Trinity</hi> in the <hi>Divine Eſſence</hi> from Eternity, ſhould take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a created nature in time, and become true man: ſo that he that was a true perſon before his Incarnation, ſhould by means of his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion become God and man in one perſon; this is one great effect and demonſtration of the love of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come now to ſpeak of the ſecond great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſts love, and that is, his <hi>being made under the Law for us.</hi> And for this end I have choſen this Scripture: <hi>But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that are under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> This was another great demonſtration of the love of Chriſt, that he would not only take our nature and become true man, but that he would be <hi>made under the Law</hi> for us. To underſtand which, we muſt know, that the Son of God might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, and yet not have ſubjected himſelf to the Law in that manner as he did: for he might have glorified the humane nature in the ſame moment that he aſſumed it: but that Chriſt would become ſubject to the Law, and paſs under ſuch a courſe of obedience before he entred into his glory; this was the great love of Chriſt to us.</p>
                  <p>There are great Articles of Faith contained in theſe words;
<note place="margin">Paueis ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis multa complexus eſt.</note> in a few words there are many things comprehended. We ſhall find ſeven or eight great Articles of Faith comprehended in theſe few words.</p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:99997:82"/>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt great Article of Faith is this, <hi>That God had a Son, one that was in a peculiar manner his Son, and diſtinguiſhed from all other ſons. [God ſent forth his Son.]</hi> There is a great Emphalis lyes in that expreſſion, <hi>his Son.</hi> God ſent a Son that was peculiarly <hi>his Son,</hi> his Son in a way of <hi>eminency</hi> and <hi>peculiarity</hi> from all others ſons. Therefore is this Son elſewhere called his <hi>own Son,</hi> his <hi>proper Son, Rom.</hi> 8.32. and his <hi>only begotten Son, Joh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The Son of the living God, Joh.</hi> 6.69. The Angels and <hi>Adam</hi> were the ſons of God by creation, but theſe were not ſuch ſons as this Son was. This Son that the Text ſpeaks of, was not the Son of God by <hi>Creation,</hi> but by <hi>eternal Generation, Joh.</hi> 16.28. <hi>I came out from the Father, and ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> come into the world.</hi> Chriſt came forth from the Father by <hi>eternal Generation,</hi> he came into the world by his <hi>Incarnation.</hi> There we ſee his <hi>coming forth from the Father,</hi> and his <hi>coming into the world</hi> are diſtinguiſhed one from the other. He came forth from the Father by his <hi>eternal Generation,</hi> and he came into the world by his <hi>Incarnation:</hi> Heb. 1.5. <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</hi> Prov. 8.25. <hi>Before the mountains were ſetled was I begotten.</hi> Hence is Chriſt ſaid to be <hi>the firſt-begotten of every creature, Col.</hi> 1.25. It is not ſaid <hi>the firſt created</hi> of every creature, but the <hi>firſt begotten</hi> of every creature. The meaning is, that before the <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were made</hi> and created, Chriſt was <hi>begotten</hi> by the Father. He is not therefore to be placed in the rank of creatures, he was <hi>begotten,</hi> not <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> he was before the creature had any being and exiſtence, and therefore by conſequence from Eternity.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:99997:82"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Article of Faith delivered in theſe words, is this, <hi>That the Son of God had a preexiſtence, and was in being before he took our nature.</hi> Mark how the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, <hi>God ſent forth his Son.</hi> He ſent him forth:
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>emiſit.</hi>
                     </note> it is not ſimply expreſſed, he ſent him, but he ſent him <hi>forth.</hi> Now if God <hi>ſent forth</hi> his Son, it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he was in being before he was ſo ſent forth. And if we would know where this Son was before he was ſent forth, the Evangeliſt tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The ſame was in the beginning with God.</hi> That very Son, who afterwards he ſaith was <hi>incarnate</hi> and <hi>made fleſh, verſ.</hi> 14. this <hi>very</hi> Son in the beginning <hi>was with God.</hi> Therefore the Son was with the Father, coexiſtent with him before he was ſent forth into mans nature. Some Hereticks have denied that Chriſt is the Son of God in reſpect of eternal Generation, and that Chriſt had no exiſtence before he took fleſh from the Virgin; but this Scripture cuts the throat of that <hi>Hereſie:</hi> for this Scripture plainly teacheth us, That Chriſt was the Son of God before he was <hi>ſent,</hi> before he was <hi>made of a woman,</hi> before he was <hi>made under the Law. God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law.</hi> He was <hi>firſt his Son,</hi> before he was ſent forth, before he was made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, before he was made under the Law.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Article of Faith contained in theſe words is this, <hi>That God had decreed and promiſed to ſend forth his Son before he did actually ſend him into our nature. God ſent forth his Son.</hi> This is implied, God had a purpoſe to ſend him forth before, and he had promiſed to ſend him forth; and when the <hi>fulneſs of time</hi> was come, then did he actually ſend him forth. <hi>In the fulneſs of time God ſent forth
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:99997:83"/>his Son:</hi> as much as if it had been ſaid, What he he had <hi>purpoſed</hi> and <hi>promiſed</hi> before, he did in due time <hi>accompliſh.</hi> If it be asked, Where did God promiſe to ſend forth his Son? The firſt great promiſe was in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the ſerpents head.</hi> The meaning of that promiſe was, the Son of God ſhould take fleſh of the ſeed of the woman, and ſo become a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the Elect. This promiſe was renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when God told him, <hi>In his ſeed all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed.</hi> This promiſe alſo was renewed to <hi>David,</hi> when God told him, <hi>Of the fruit of his loyns, according to the fleſh, he would raiſe up Chriſt to ſit on his Throne, Act.</hi> 2.30. It was alſo made to the Prophets in thoſe many promiſes that were made concerning the Meſſias.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Article contained in theſe words is this, <hi>That the Son of God, who was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed long before, was actually exhibited and manifeſted in the fleſh. God ſent forth his Son:</hi> that is, he ſent him <hi>into our nature to take fleſh, Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh. He ſent forth his Son.</hi> We muſt conceive of this aright, not that Chriſt as to his <hi>Divine perſon,</hi> did ceaſe to be where he was before: no, it is ſaid of him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The only begotten Son who is in the boſom of the Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </note> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the preſent tenſe. <hi>Who is in the boſom of the Father.</hi> The only begotten Son after his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation <hi>is ſtill in the boſom of the Father.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour ſaith of himſelf, even whilſt he was here on earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.13. <hi>The Son of man who is in heaven.</hi> He that was on earth at that time in reſpect of his <hi>humane nature,</hi> was in Heaven at the ſame time in reſpect of his <hi>Divine nature.</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:99997:83"/>Therefore whenas it is ſaid here, God ſent forth his Son, thus we ought to conceive of it, God ſent forth his Son, not by any change of place, but of condition. He that was in the <hi>form of God</hi> before, by his Incarnation took on him the <hi>form of a ſervant.</hi> Chriſt therefore as God did not begin to be and exiſt when he was firſt incarnate, no, <hi>in the beginning he was with God:</hi> but he began by his Incarnation to be <hi>true man,</hi> who was <hi>God</hi> before <hi>from Eternity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth Article of Faith contained in theſe words is this, <hi>That the Son of God was incarnate and made man in the beſt time. When the fulneſs of time was come God ſent forth his Son.</hi> Our curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity is apt to inquire, Why did not Chriſt come in the fleſh ſooner? Had it not been more for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage, if the Son of God had ſooner taken our nature? But the Spirit of God ſilenceth all theſe reaſonings by telling us, <hi>When the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son.</hi> God loſt no time, he ſlipt no time; when the compleat time was come that was predetermined in his holy Decree, and before ſignified in his promiſes, then <hi>he ſent forth his Son.</hi> God accompliſheth all his promiſes in the beſt time and ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth Article of Faith is this, <hi>That the manner of Chriſts Conception and Incarnation was wonderful and extraordinary. God ſent forth his Son made of a woman.</hi> It is not ſaid <hi>born</hi> of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but <hi>made</hi> of a woman. <hi>Made of a woman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that is, he did partake of the ſubſtance of the Virgin. <hi>Becauſe the children were made partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf likewiſe took part of the ſame, Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>He was made of a woman,</hi> that ſhews he was <hi>true man,</hi> and had a <hi>true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99997:84"/>nature:</hi> but in that it is ſaid he was <hi>made,</hi> not <hi>born</hi> or <hi>begotten,</hi> that ſhews Chriſt had his Original as man not in the common way of <hi>generation. Eve</hi> was made out of one of the ribs taken out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſide, and <hi>Adam</hi> could ſay of her, <hi>She is fleſh of my fleſh, and bone of my bone:</hi> and <hi>Chriſt as man</hi> his humanity was formed out of the ſubſtance of the Virgin; ſo that we may ſay, This was fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone. <hi>Made of a woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The ſeventh Article of Faith comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe words is this, <hi>That although Chriſt hath two Natures in him, yet he hath but one Perſon.</hi> For here is but <hi>one Son</hi> that is ſpoken of in the Text. <hi>God ſent forth his Son made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> He that was the <hi>Son</hi> of God from <hi>Eternity,</hi> and <hi>made</hi> of a woman <hi>in time,</hi> is ſtill <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Son. It is the <hi>Son</hi> that is ſent forth, the <hi>Son</hi> that is made of a woman, the <hi>Son</hi> that is made under the Law: ſo that ſtill, though Chriſt hath <hi>two Natures,</hi> yet he hath but <hi>one Perſon.</hi> Chriſt had not a <hi>new Perſon,</hi> but a <hi>new Nature</hi> added to him by his Incarnation; and therefore we commonly ſay, the humane nature is without any perſonal ſubſiſtence of its own, but it ſubſiſts in the Divine perſon, who was a perſon from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Theſe ſeven great Articles of Faith are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in theſe few words; ſo that we may ſay with one of the Ancients, <hi>I adore the fulneſs of the Scriptures.</hi> See how many great weighty Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith are comprehended in a few words.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The laſt Article contained in this verſe is this, <hi>That Chriſt was made under the Law. God ſent forth his Son made of a woman, made under the Law.</hi> The <hi>end</hi> of his being made under the Law
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99997:84"/>is ſet down in the next verſe, <hi>To redeem us who were under the Law, that we might receive the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the ſecond great effect of Chriſts love I am now to ſpeak of, <hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts being <hi>made under the Law.</hi> For this we muſt carry all along with us, whatever Chriſt was, whatever he did, and ſuffered, was for us: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. Hence is it, that Chriſt is called <hi>the gift of God, Joh.</hi> 4.10. Chriſt is <hi>the gift of God to us.</hi> He is made <hi>of God to us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt was, whatſoever he did, it was not for himſelf, or his own ſake, but for us; and therefore his being made under the Law was for us, and ſo it is expreſſed here in the Text, <hi>He was made under the Law to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of ſons.</hi> The end of Chriſts being made under the Law was to accompliſh our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. Here there are two things to be ſpoken unto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it is for Chriſt to be made under the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Wherein did the greatneſs of Chriſts love appear in being made under the Law?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is it for Chriſt to be made under the Law? Before I come to enter upon the main ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I muſt neceſſarily lay down ſome <hi>preliminary</hi> or <hi>previous</hi> Propoſitions for the clearing of the whole.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Propoſition is this, The Law of God is the <hi>Tranſcript</hi> or <hi>Copy</hi> of Gods <hi>Holineſs.</hi> The <hi>holy Nature</hi> of God and his <hi>pure Will</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cypher'd and diſplayed to us in his Law. The
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:99997:85"/>Law of God is nothing elſe but the declaration of his holy nature, and of his holy will. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Be ye holy, for I the Lord your God am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Holineſs</hi> in us is our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law; when we are conformable to the Law (which is the Rule of Holineſs) then are we in our meaſure holy as God is holy. In the Law of God we ſee what things are conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Gods nature, what are repugnant to his nature; in the Law we ſee what is agreeing to the will of God, what is diſſonant and diſagreeing to his will. The Law of God is nothing elſe but the declaration of the <hi>eternal Will</hi> of God. God that is moſt holy in himſelf, cannot but will every thing in the moſt <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> manner. And the Law is nothing elſe but the declaration of Gods holy will concerning his creatures. Now the will of God being moſt perfect and holy in it ſelf, the Law (which is the declaration of Gods will) muſt needs alſo be moſt perfect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is there this <hi>Epithete</hi> given to the Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. <hi>The law of God is perfect, converting the ſoul.</hi> Alſo that it is <hi>very pure, Pſal.</hi> 119.140. The Law of God is the pure will of a pure God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Law of God is <hi>immutable, perpetual,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting.</hi> Still we muſt remember I am now ſpeaking of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, for the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law is of another nature. But that which we call the Moral Law is <hi>immutable, perpetual,</hi> and <hi>everlaſting.</hi> And the reaſon is, God being immutable and unchangeable in his nature and his will, the Law (which is the declaration of his nature and will) muſt needs be immutable, perpetual, and everlaſting. Hence are thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.142. <hi>Thy righteouſneſs is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99997:85"/>an everlaſting righteouſneſs, and thy law is the truth.</hi> And <hi>verſ.</hi> 144. <hi>The righteouſneſs of thy teſtimonies is everlaſting.</hi> Hence alſo is it that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>One iota and tittle of the law ſhall not paſs away, Mat.</hi> 5.18. The Law of God is of eternal equity, and therefore it cannot paſs away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Every reaſonable creature is <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>indiſpenſably</hi> under the authority of the Law. There are two things implied in every Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>Declaration</hi> of the <hi>Will</hi> of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. An <hi>Obligation</hi> upon the perſons to whom the Law is given, to obey and keep the Law.</p>
                  <p>Now every reaſonable creature is under the obligation of the Law. It implies a contradiction for God to make a creature, and not to make him under a Law; for he who is not ſupreme, muſt needs be ſubject to the will of him who is ſupreme. Either the creature's will muſt be a law to it ſelf, or elſe Gods will muſt be a law to it: the creature's will cannot be a law to the creature, becauſe it is a <hi>created</hi> will, and there is an <hi>increated will</hi> which is above it: the creature receives its being from another, and therefore muſt needs be under the will of him, and under the diſpoſe of him, from whom it receives its being. It is impoſſible for God to make a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not that creature to be under an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to love, fear, ſerve, and obey his Maker.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Propoſition is this, God <hi>juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies</hi> no perſon, nor receives any perſon into <hi>actual favour</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> with him without a <hi>perfect righteouſneſs</hi> anſwering <hi>exactly</hi> to the law. And the reaſon of this depends upon the former Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. The righteouſneſs that is in the Law
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99997:86"/>is the Tranſcript and Copy of Gods Holineſs: now God requires holineſs in the creature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to his own Holineſs. <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, Pſal.</hi> 11.7. God being righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in his nature, requires righteouſneſs from the creature. The Law of God is immutable, perpetual, and everlaſting, and God doth indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably require righteouſneſs from the creature. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Moſes deſcribes the righteouſneſs of the law, that the man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> The Law gives life to none but where it is fulfilled; <hi>the man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them.</hi> It is true, the Law of the Covenant of Works did not only require <hi>perfect obedience,</hi> but it alſo required <hi>perſonal obedience.</hi> The Law of the <hi>first Covenant</hi> did not admit of obedience by a <hi>ſurety,</hi> but it required that a man ſhould obey the Law in his own perſon. But this is diſpenſed with in the ſecond Covenant. The ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant accepts of obedience from a ſurety: but obedience is ſtill required, yea perfect exact obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. God juſtifies no perſon but where there is a perfect compleat righteouſneſs every way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the rule of the Law. It is not poſſible, that the righteouſneſs of the Law can be diſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and therefore there muſt be a righteouſneſs anſwering the righteouſneſs of the Law. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26. <hi>God is juſt, and the juſtifier of him which believeth in Jeſus.</hi> God muſt find out a righteouſneſs ſomewhere before he ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies any perſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth Propoſition is this, No man ſince the Fall can fulfil the righteouſneſs of the Law, or perform that obedience which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires. Hence is it, that the Apoſtle tells us,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99997:86"/>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. that <hi>The law is weak through the fleſh.</hi> The plain meaning of that Scripture is this, The Law would juſtifie men in caſe men could keep the Law, but no man is able to keep the Law, and therefore he cannot be juſtified by it. <hi>The Law is weak,</hi> that is, it is <hi>weak</hi> as to <hi>Juſtification.</hi> The Law is able to juſtifie no man: but this <hi>weakneſs of the Law is through the fleſh.</hi> The weakneſs is not on the Laws part, but on mans part, that he is not able to keep the Law. Man ſince the Fall cannot keep the Law, and ſo the Law is weak through the fleſh. Man ſince the Fall is become <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>fleſhly.</hi> And the Apoſtle tells us in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Man by his Fall hath weakened himſelf, man hath loſt his power to fulfil the Law, and ſo cannot poſſibly attain to life by the Law.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth and laſt Propoſition is this, If God juſtifie any perſon, he muſt find out and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a righteouſneſs of his own, and beſtow that upon men for their Juſtification. Therefore ſince man cannot fulfil the Law himſelf, and God will not diſpenſe with the righteouſneſs of the Law, God (if he pleaſe to ſave men) muſt find out ſome other way how the Law may be fulfilled. And this was the way God found out, The Son of God muſt take to himſelf the nature of man, and in the nature of man muſt fulfil the righteouſneſs of the Law. And thus Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>the end of the Law for righteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 10.3. The Law which was never fulfilled before, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfilled by Chriſt. <hi>The complement of the Law</hi> (ſays a Learned man) <hi>lyes in this, That our
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:99997:87"/>ſins are pardoned for Chriſts ſake, and that the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed to us, whenas he is our Head and we are his Members.</hi> Hence is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the law ſaid to be fulfilled in us. It is an emphatical expreſſion, <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us, Rom.</hi> 8.4. Not that it is poſſible for a Believer to fulfil the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the law in his own perſon; but a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever being one with Chriſt, fulfils the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the law in the perſon of his Head. The Son of God taking humane nature, doth perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfil the law in the humane nature aſſumed. So that now in Chriſt, who was made under the law for us, there is found ſuch a righteouſneſs as is every way anſwerable to the law, and this Righteouſneſs of his is imputed to Believers. Therefore is Chriſt ſaid to be <hi>made of God to us righteouſneſs,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. And, <hi>We are made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Learn from hence the reaſon why it is impoſſible that any man ſhould be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of this <hi>own,</hi> by an <hi>inherent righteouſneſs:</hi> the reaſon is, If a man be juſtified by an <hi>inherent righteouſneſs,</hi> a righteouſneſs of his own working, he muſt produce ſuch a righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as is perfect and exact, and every way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering and conformable to the law. The Law of God admits of no ſuch righteouſneſs for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as is not perfect and exact, and every way anſwerable to that purity and perfection the law requires. Conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.14. <hi>The law is ſpiritual.</hi> Spiritual, what is the meaning of that? The law requires utmoſt <hi>perfection, Angelical perfection,</hi> ſuch a kind of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as hath not the leaſt <hi>flaw</hi> or <hi>defect</hi> in it.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99997:87"/>The law ſpeaks after this manner, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the law to do them.</hi> Firſt, if a man be juſtified by the <hi>Law</hi> by an <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſs,</hi> a man muſt do <hi>all things</hi> the law requires. If it could be ſuppoſed a man could do many things that the law requires, yet if he did not <hi>do all things,</hi> if he did not fulfil to every part and punctilio in the law, he would fall ſhort of life by the law. Secondly, as a man muſt be <hi>univerſal</hi> in his obedience, ſo he muſt be <hi>conſtant</hi> and <hi>uniform</hi> in his obedience; <hi>Curſed is he that continues not in all things.</hi> If it could be ſuppoſed a man could fulfil the whole law for that part of his life which is to come, yet if he have not fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it for that part of his life which is paſt, he hath fallen ſhort of what the law requires. The law requires conſtant and uniform obedience. Now which of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> is there that can ſay he hath fulfilled the law in <hi>every point</hi> and <hi>tittle,</hi> and this <hi>conſtantly</hi> throughout his whole life? If none of the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> dare ſay ſo, then certainly none can be juſtified by an <hi>inherent righteouſneſs.</hi> It is true, that <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> are inſeparable companions, and where the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is imputed for Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, there alſo is a work of Sanctification, and in that ſenſe inherent righteouſneſs wrought in the Soul by the Spirit of Chriſt: but becauſe the work of Sanctification is but inchoate, begun, and imperfect only in this life, therefore that cannot be the matter of our righteouſneſs before God. Therefore we muſt ſeek for another righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, a righteouſneſs without us, and that is the Righteouſneſs of our Head the Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:99997:88"/>who was made under the law for us, and hath brought in ſuch a righteouſneſs as is every way anſwerable to the law. For God will accept no righteouſneſs for a man, without it be that which is every way exact and commenſurate to the law.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been laid down, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> we may ſee the inexpreſſible miſery of all Unbelievers, and ſuch as lye out of Chriſt. Their miſery appears in this, No unrighteous perſon can enter into Heaven. The Scripture tells us ſo in plain terms, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Know ye not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God?</hi> Now all that are in the ſtate of nature, that are not implanted into Chriſt by faith, are <hi>unrighteous.</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaking of all men in the ſtate of nature, what they are before faith, it tells us, <hi>There is no man righteous, no not one, Rom.</hi> 3.10. In ſhort, this is the miſery of Unbelievers, they cannot produce ſuch a righteouſneſs of their own for which the law ſhould juſtifie them: nay, they have all that ſin and unrighteouſneſs in them for which the law condemns them. And as they have not that righteouſneſs of their own, for which the law ſhould juſtifie them; ſo they can lay no claim to the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they have no intereſt in the righteouſneſs of a ſurety that ſhould anſwer for them. They never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and cloſed with Chriſt, and ſo have no part in his Righteouſneſs. Great and inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is the miſery of all ſuch who content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to remain and abide out of Chriſt, God is reſolved to have his Law ſatisfied one way or other, either the Law of God muſt be ſatisfied in a way of obedience, or elſe the penalty of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:99997:88"/>law muſt be inflicted on the Sinner for default of that obedience. For thus doth the tenor of the law run, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile.</hi> There is a great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis in thoſe words, <hi>upon every ſoul of man:</hi> as much as if it had been ſaid, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon every individual perſon.</hi> The Law of God ſpares no man; the Law of God ſpares no perſon whatſoever; the Law of God where-ever it finds a Sinner, it doth condemn him. <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoul of man that doth evil.</hi> The Law of God remits not of that obedience which it requires, nor of that puniſhment which it threatens for want of ſuch obedience. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the Damned lye under the wrath of God, and the curſe of the Law to all Eternity; they have not ſatisfied the law in a way of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and therefore the law is ſtill ſatisfying it ſelf upon them in a way of puniſhment. O therefore let it not ſeem an indifferent thing to any of us, whether we get into the Lord Jeſus yea or no, and whether we get a part in his Righteouſneſs yea or no. Unleſs you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch a righteouſneſs as is anſwerable to the law, a perfect righteouſneſs, when you come to ſtand before Gods Tribunal, you will never eſcape condemnation. Now this perfect righteouſneſs you can never find in your ſelves, therefore you have reaſon to ſeek for it elſewhere, and that is in Chriſt, and in him only. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth on the Son is not condemned,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we deſerve condemnation as we are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet we have his own word for it, If we believe on the Son, we ſhall not be condemned,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:99997:89"/>
                     <hi>He that believeth on the Son is not condemned.</hi> Though men deſerve condemnation, yet he that <hi>believes on the Son is not actually condemned.</hi> He hath ſomething in him <hi>condemnable,</hi> he hath <hi>ſin</hi> in him that would condemn him, but believing on the Son he is not <hi>actually condemned.</hi> There is no way to ſave men from the condemnation of the Law, but by getting a part in the Lord Jeſus. If we believe on the Son of God, God will accept of the Righteouſneſs of his Son, as if we had wrought out righteouſneſs in our own perſon. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See and behold the infinite love of God to his people, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> in providing a righteouſneſs for them as to their Juſtification, and beſtowing it upon them whenas they could not work it out themſelves. This is ſet forth at large by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God is revealed from faith to faith.</hi> God reveals a righteouſneſs for us of his own beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereas we had none of our own, neither could procure any of our own. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.21. <hi>Now the righteouſneſs of God without the law is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteouſneſs of God which is by faith of Jeſus Chriſt unto all and upon all them that believe.</hi> As much as if he had ſaid, Herein is the great love of God to his people, that he finds out and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows a righteouſneſs upon them which they could never find nor work out for themſelves. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.12, 13. <hi>Hearken unto me, ye ſtout-hearted, that are far from righteouſneſs, I bring near my righteouſneſs, it ſhall not be far off.</hi> We were all

                     <hi>far from righteouſneſs,</hi> but God hath brought near his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> a Righteouſneſs wrought by his own Son in a part of our nature. God hath now depoſited a Righteouſneſs for us in a part of our own nature. Chriſt that was fleſh of our fleſh, and bone of our bone, was made under the law, and hath fulfilled the law in our nature.</p>
                  <p>This ſhould exhort us <hi>humbly</hi> to accept of that Righteouſneſs which God hath provided and freely tenders. Our work, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> when we come to God for Juſtification, is not to bring a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of our own, but humbly to accept of that righteouſneſs which he freely offers and tenders unto us. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Believing</hi> here, is nothing elſe but the ſouls <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>affectionate</hi> accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that righteouſneſs which God reveals.

                  <p>IN our former Diſcourſe two things were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be ſpoken unto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew what it is for Chriſt to be <hi>made under the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew wherein the greatneſs of Chriſts love doth diſcover it ſelf in being <hi>made under the Law</hi> for us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is it for Chriſt to be made under the Law?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall explain this in three Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For Chriſt to be made under the Law, it is for Chriſt to take upon him the Office of a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and <hi>Surety</hi> for us: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. <hi>There is one Mediator between God and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> So likewiſe <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. Chriſt is called <hi>the ſurety of a better Teſtament,</hi> or <hi>the ſurety of a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> A <hi>Mediator, Surety,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker,</hi> ſo the <hi>Criticks</hi> in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue explain that word.

                        </gap>.</note> A Surety is one that mediates for another, he freely and voluntarily undertakes fro him, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to be reſponſible for him, and to diſcharge his debt. No man is compelled to be a Surety, but it is his own <hi>voluntary</hi> act. He is free in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, yet he is willing of his own accord to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the concernments of another. Thus Chriſt who is our Surety was free in himſelf from all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:99997:91"/>to the Law, but he was pleaſed freely and voluntarily to become our ſurety, and to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the diſcharge of our debt. And thus <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds this Text,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chriſtus Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Dei qui immunis ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re fuiſſet omni ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione, legis fuit ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</hi> Calv.</note> 
                     <hi>He was made under the Law,</hi> that is, ſaith he, <hi>Chriſt the Son of God, who by right had been free from all ſubjection, was yet ſubject to the Law.</hi> Why ſo? It was for our ſake, and it was in our name and ſtead, that he might obtain liberty for us: even as he that was a free-man himſelf, by becoming furety for another, redeems him that was captive, and by taking his Fetters and Bonds upon him, delivers him from his bonds: ſo Chriſt would make himſelf liable to the keeping of the Law, that he might purchaſe liberty for us; for otherwiſe Chriſt had in vain taken the yoke of the Law upon him; for certainly it was not for his own ſake that he took it. Every ſon and daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> is neceſſarily under the Law, and owes a debt of obedience to the Law. Now we being inſolvent, and not able to pay that debt of obedience which the Law requires, Chriſt was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> and was content to pay the debt that we could not pay. It is true, Chriſt being made under the Law, doth not exempt Believers from being under the Law as a <hi>Rule,</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are ſtill under the Law as a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>life</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> But thus we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ght to conceive of it, It being not poſſible for us to <hi>fulfil</hi> the Law, and to perform that <hi>exact obedience</hi> which the Law requires, and yet a perfect obedience being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, Chriſt <hi>is the end of the Law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as is expreſſed in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. that is, Chriſt undertook to perform that perfect obedience which the Law required, and ſo to anſwer the end of the Law for righteouſneſs. The Law was
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:99997:91"/>given to man in <hi>Innocency,</hi> for this end, that it might have been the matter of mans righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in caſe he had obeyed and kept the law. <hi>The righteouſneſs of the law is deſcribed by this, The man which doth thoſe things ſhall live by them, Rom.</hi> 10.5. But now no man <hi>ſince</hi> the <hi>Fall</hi> being able to keep the law and fulfil it, and yet God requiring ſtill that the law ſhould be obeyed, and the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it fulfilled, Chriſt was content freely and of his own accord (who was otherwiſe free and diſingaged) to be <hi>under the Law,</hi> and by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the law to bring in ſuch a righteouſneſs as the law requires.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For Chriſt to be made under the law is to put himſelf under the <hi>obligation</hi> of the law, and to make himſelf <hi>liable</hi> unto it. Although a man be willing to be <hi>Surety</hi> for another; yet till he brings himſelf under <hi>bonds</hi> and <hi>obligations,</hi> he is not properly a <hi>Surety.</hi> A Surety is one that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the obligation upon himſelf, when the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal debtor is not able to pay: ſo that whatever the debt is, the ſurety who is ingaged, ſtands un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an obligation to ſee it ſatisfied. Chriſt then becoming our Surety, all that obligation that lay upon us from the law, is now derived upon him. Now Chriſt brings himſelf under this obligation to the law two ways. 1. By his own <hi>free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> and <hi>ſtipulation</hi> to the Father. He that is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe free, if he enter into Bonds and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants to diſcharge anothers debt, become an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged</hi> perſon. Though he were free before, he is now no longer free, but becomes engaged by his own voluntary <hi>conſent.</hi> Thus Chriſt who was free and diſingaged in himſelf, did enter into a Covenant and agreement with the Father to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:99997:92"/>our cauſe, and to do and ſuffer what was <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be done and ſuffered in order to our Salvation: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. <hi>Then I ſaid, Lo I come, in the volume of the book it is written of me, To do thy will, O God.</hi> When Chriſt ſaw the Fathers heart was ſet on the Salvation of man, and that for that end the Father was willing Chriſt ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the cauſe and buſineſs of their Salvation, Chriſt was as willing as the Father was, and he ſaith, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will.</hi> Hence is it that the <hi>Counſel of Peace</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>between them both, Zac.</hi> 6.13. The Father (to ſpeak after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of men) <hi>propounds,</hi> and the Son <hi>conſents:</hi> ſo that the Son (who was free and diſingaged in himſelf) brings himſelf under an obligation by his own free promiſe and ſtipulation. Hence it is, that Chriſt becomes the Head of the ſecond Covenant, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and all the Elect are his ſeed, and Chriſt undertakes for them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. 2. Chriſt brought himſelf under obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to the Law by his own <hi>voluntary aſſumption of our nature,</hi> for that end, that he might become ſubject to the Law in it. This the Apoſtle ſets forth at large, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He was in the form of God, and counted it no robbery to be equal with God, but he made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men; and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf and became obedient.</hi> Here are two things by which the Apoſtle ſets forth the greatneſs of Chriſts <hi>Condeſcenſion.</hi> 1. That he being in the <hi>form of God,</hi> and who might have continued in the <hi>form of God only,</hi> yet that he was pleaſed to take upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant</hi> and become <hi>true</hi> man, this is one part of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:99997:92"/>The other part of his condeſcenſion is, that he would take upon him the form of a ſervant and become man, for this very end, that he might become <hi>obedient,</hi> and that he might perform all the acts of obedience in the humane nature aſſumed. Chriſt was not bound to take our nature at all, but he might have continued always in the form of God <hi>only;</hi> or if he will take our nature, he was not bound to take it in that <hi>ſervile</hi> way, ſo as to be bound to all acts of obedience: but here was the greatneſs of Chriſts condeſcenſion, as he will take our nature, ſo he will take it for <hi>that end,</hi> that in our nature he may <hi>obey</hi> and <hi>fulfil</hi> the Law for us. And therefore it is emphatically expreſſed in the <hi>Original,
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </note> He was made obedient,</hi> and ſo in the Text, <hi>He was made under the Law.</hi> Chriſt was made or <hi>reduced under</hi> the Law, ſo ſome render it. Chriſt was reduced to that ſtate and condition, as to be in a ſtate of ſubjection to the Law, whereas he was <hi>naturally</hi> above it. Chriſt was made or reduced under this power and authority of the Law by his own <hi>free conſent,</hi> whereas naturally the Law had no ſuch power or authority over him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third and laſt Propoſition is this, For Chriſt to be under the Law is to be under the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diriſction of the Law,</hi> and to be <hi>actually</hi> ſubject to it. Chriſt having put himſelf under the obligation of the law, the law hath full power and authority over him, and the law requires perfect and exact obedience from him, as it doth from any other man, and Chriſt doth now ſtand bound and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to yield and perform that obedience which the law requires. Hence Chriſt is called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. the <hi>Fathers ſervant,</hi> he is ſaid to love the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:99997:93"/>Father, to do and keep the Fathers command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.31. &amp; 15.10. Chriſt <hi>as man</hi> was under a law of love and obedience to his Father, he was alſo ſubject to his Parents <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> he ſubmitted to the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> and gives this reaſon for it, <hi>Thus it becomes us to fulfil all righteouſneſs, Mat.</hi> 3.15. Chriſt being made man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming our ſurety, and being made under the law for us, was bound to <hi>all the moral Duties</hi> which the law requires, and ſo to fulfil all righteouſneſs for us. And the reaſon of it is, If Chriſt had left any thing undone that the law requires of us, then there had been ſo far a defect in that which was to become our righteouſneſs, for the <hi>obedience</hi> of Chriſt was to be the matter of our <hi>righteouſneſs, Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>By the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous.</hi> The law accepts of nothing but a perfect compleat righteouſneſs; therefore if Chriſt had left any thing to be done that the law requires to be done, there had been ſo far a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in that which muſt be our righteouſneſs for Juſtification; therefore Chriſt was obliged to all that obedience which the law required from us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I come now to the ſecond thing, to ſhew wherein the greatneſs of the love of Chriſt doth appear and diſcover it ſelf in his <hi>being made under the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall lay down ſeveral Propoſitions for the clearing of this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The love of Chriſt in being made under the law appears in this, In that Chriſt in reſpect of his <hi>Original right</hi> was free from all ſubjection to the law. Chriſt in reſpect of his perſon and his Divine nature was above the law; Chriſt as he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:99997:93"/>was God, was <hi>Supreme</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of the law; as he was the ſecond perſon in the Trinity, ſo he was equal to the Father, and of equal authority with him. It is true, the <hi>humane nature</hi> in Chriſt was a creature, and therefore in a ſtate of ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as every creature muſt neceſſarily be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be. But then we muſt conſider, that although the humane nature of Chriſt be a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſidered ſimply ſo, is in a ſtate of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; yet Chriſt in reſpect of his <hi>Original</hi> right is free from all ſubjection. And this may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced from theſe following Conſiderations. 1. Although it be true, that the <hi>humane nature</hi> in Chriſt be a creature, yet the humane nature hath its ſubſiſtence in and by that perſon who is <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>increated.</hi> And hence is it, that the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> do deny, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be called a <hi>Creature.</hi> There is a great difference between theſe two <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> to ſay, That the <hi>humane nature</hi> in Chriſt is a creature, and to ſay, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for <hi>Chriſt is the name of the perſon that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in both natures.</hi> Therefore though it be true,
<note place="margin">Chriſtus eſt nomen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonae in dua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</note> that one of the natures in Chriſt is a <hi>creature,</hi> yet the <hi>perſon</hi> is <hi>Divine,</hi> and no creature; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. that Chriſt, though he <hi>came of the fathers concerning the fleſh,</hi> yet <hi>he is over all, God bleſſed for ever.</hi> Although Chriſt, as to the fleſh, and in reſpect of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, came of the Fathers, and we ſay truly and properly his humanity is a creature: yet his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is Divine, and Chriſt is ſtill <hi>God bleſſed for ever.</hi> 2. We muſt know that the humane nature of Chriſt never in any moment of time ſubſiſted of it ſelf or by it ſelf, but always had its ſubſiſtence in the Divine perſon: and the reaſon is this; If
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:99997:94"/>we ſhould ſuppoſe the humane nature at any time ſubſiſt in it ſelf out of the Divine perſon, that would neceſſarily infer there were two perſons in Chriſt, which is moſt contrary to the Doctrine of the Scriptures. Therefore although we do ſuppoſe the humane nature, ſimply in it ſelf conſidered, to be a creature, and in a ſtate of ſubjection; yet conſidering that the humanity was always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally united to the Divinity, and the humane nature never ſubſiſted out of the Divine perſon, we muſt conclude that Chriſt was no otherways in a ſtate of ſubjection, than what he brought himſelf into by his voluntary condeſcenſion. Therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>He emptied himſelf, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and became obedient.</hi> As it was part of his condeſcenſion he would <hi>take upon him the form of a ſervant:</hi> ſo this was another part of it, he would <hi>become obedient</hi> for our ſakes. 3. We muſt conſider it was a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary act in Chriſt to aſſume our nature. Chriſt took our nature indeed, but he was not bound to it, it was his own free and voluntary act, that he did aſſume it. 4. We muſt alſo conſider, that Chriſt did not loſe the <hi>Digniey</hi> of his perſon by his aſſumption of our nature. He was the Son of God before his Incarnation, and ſo he was after; he was God before he took mans nature, and ſo remained ſtill. It is true, Chriſt in the ſtate of his Humiliation, was content to have the Glory of his Divinity <hi>hid</hi> and <hi>obſcured</hi> for a time: and this is that the Apoſtle calls <hi>his emptying himſelf.</hi> But yet Chriſt did not, neither could he <hi>diveſt</hi> himſelf of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> neither did he loſe the <hi>eſſential Dignity</hi> of his perſon. He was the Son of God, and God after as well as before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:99997:94"/>5. Chriſt might, if he had pleaſed, without running ſuch a courſe of obedience here on earth, have glorified the humane nature when firſt he aſſumed it. For this is granted by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> That Chriſt, by virtue of the perſonal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had a <hi>natural right</hi> unto Glory. The Son of God incarnate and become man, continues to be the Son of God, yea the <hi>natural Son</hi> of God. And hence is it the School-men do truly ſay, That <hi>Chriſt-man</hi> is the natural Son of God. Therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That Chriſt is more excellent than the Angels, becauſe he hath obtained a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent name by inheritance than they, Heb.</hi> 1.4. And what name is this? to be <hi>the Son of God.</hi> Conſider <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.</hi> Now the Apoſtle tells us, Chriſt had this name by <hi>inheritance,</hi> that is, he was <hi>naturally</hi> the Son of God, and therefore <hi>naturally</hi> an Heir to all the Father was poſſeſſed of. Now as he was the Son of God before his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> ſo he did not ceaſe to be the Son of God by his Incarnation. Therefore Chriſt had a natural right to Glory, and might, if he had pleaſed, have glorified the humane nature when he aſſumed it. Now then, as the reſult of all that hath been ſaid, follows, That Chriſt would become, and put himſelf into a <hi>ſtate of ſubjection</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> this was for our ſakes, and it was his <hi>voluntary condeſcenſion</hi> ſo to do. Nay the Apoſtle tells us expreſly in the Text, <hi>He was made under the Law to redeem them that were under the Law:</hi> So that it was for <hi>our ſakes</hi> Chriſt put himſelf into this ſtate of ſubjection, and it was his voluntary condeſcenſion ſo to do. We may not ſuppoſe Chriſt was neceſſitated to
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:99997:95"/>be in this ſtate of ſubjection. True indeed, it is ſaid of Chriſt as man and Mediator, <hi>That the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than he, Joh.</hi> 14.28. and Chriſt as man is <hi>under God</hi> as his <hi>Head:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. <hi>The head of every man is Chriſt, and the head of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is the man, and the head of Chriſt is God.</hi> But then we muſt ſtill remember: 1. It was at Chriſts liberty, whether he would have become man yea or no. He was not bound to take our nature till he did freely of his own accord ingage to do ſo. 2. Remember, <hi>inequality</hi> of <hi>Office</hi> makes no <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality</hi> of <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Eſſence,</hi> although Chriſt as <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Mediator</hi> be inferiour to the Father, in a <hi>ſtate of ſubjection</hi> to the Father; yet that makes him not to be inferiour to him as to his <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Eſſence.</hi> Conſider Chriſt as the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, he accounts it <hi>no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> that is, with the Father. Conſider him as <hi>God,</hi> ſo he and the Father <hi>are one.</hi> Now that he who was equal with God, and ſo above all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſhould take upon him the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and put himſelf into a ſtate of ſubjection, this was marvellous condeſcenſion. O ſtand and admire this love! How great was his love that would come to <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> who was <hi>Lord of all,</hi> and had all obedience of right due to him from all creatures!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The greatneſs of Chriſts love in being made under the Law appears in this, That although Chriſt was free from the Law; yet by his own <hi>voluntary condeſcenſion</hi> he made himſelf <hi>ſubject</hi> to the Law as much as any of us. This the Apoſtle ſets forth <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>For both he that ſanctifies, and they who are ſanctified are all of one: for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren. Saying, I
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:99997:95"/>will declare thy Name unto my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I ſing praiſe unto thee. And again, I will put my truſt in him: and again, Behold, I and the children which God hath given me. Christ</hi> doth here put himſelf into the rank of his brethren, and he performs the ſame duties in common with them. To <hi>praiſe</hi> God in the Congregation, to <hi>truſt</hi> in God, to <hi>obey</hi> God, all theſe are moral du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: now Chriſt having aſſumed our nature, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms theſe duties in common with the reſt of his brethren.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Propoſition is this. The love of Chriſt in his being <hi>made under the Law</hi> appears in this, That Chriſt took upon him the <hi>whole debt</hi> of obedience which the Law requires. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour teaches us expreſly, That he came to <hi>fulfil</hi> the law, yea the <hi>whole</hi> law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Think not that I am come to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets, I came not to deſtroy but to fulfil.</hi> Chriſt came to fulfil the law; and how? what, a part of it? nay the <hi>whole</hi> law. Our Saviour explains himſelf to this purpoſe in the next words, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, Till heaven and earth paſs, one jot or one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the law till all be fulfilled.</hi> All the law, every part and tittle of it was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in and by Chriſt. It is the obſervation of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> That Chriſt fulfilled the <hi>natural</hi> Law and the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> moſt perfectly. By the <hi>natural Law</hi> they underſtand all the <hi>moral Duties</hi> compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in the Ten Commandments: and by the <hi>Moſaical Law</hi> they underſtand thoſe Rites and Ordinances of Worſhip, which were in a peculiar manner given to the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi> Thus Chriſt was circumciſed and preſented to the Lord in the Temple, and they offered a Sacrifice for him, <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:99997:96"/>to that which is ſaid in the Law, A pair of Turtle-doves or two young pigeons, Luk.</hi> 2.22, 23, 24. Chriſt alſo obſerved the Ordinance of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over; and as Chriſt obſerved all the <hi>Legal Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> ſo he ſubmitted to the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,</hi> which was to be a ſtanding Ordinance under the Goſpel: and he gives this reaſon for it, <hi>Thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteouſneſs, Mat.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p>Behold, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>
                     </label> from what hath been ſpoken, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Humility</hi> of the Son of God. Chriſt that was <hi>Lord of all,</hi> was yet content to become a ſervant. Chriſt was the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſervant, and he was our ſervant. 1. He was the Fathers ſervant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1. <hi>Behold my ſervant.</hi> 2. He was our ſervant: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſaid to be a <hi>Miniſter of the Circumciſion, Rom.</hi> 15.8. that is, a Miniſter to the Jewiſh Church. And he ſaith of himſelf, he came not to be <hi>miniſtred unto,</hi> but <hi>to miniſter, Mat.</hi> 20.28. How did Chriſt miniſter? Chriſt is ſaid to <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> as he doth work and do thoſe things which do concern our Redemption and Salvation. He is a <hi>Miniſter for us,</hi> a <hi>Miniſter</hi> to accompliſh the great work of Redemption and Salvation. Chriſt was <hi>made under the Law, that he might redeem us</hi> who were under the Law. Chriſt became a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> as he took upon him the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Mediator,</hi> and as he <hi>obeyed</hi> and <hi>fulfilled</hi> the Law <hi>for us.</hi> Now this is a Rule in Divinity,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tota perſon a propter aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumtam ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi formam facta nobis eſt ſerva.</hi> Zanch. <hi>Actiones ſunt ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</hi>
                     </note> That Chriſt is Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor according to <hi>both his Natures;</hi> ſo that the whole perſon, by means of his taking on him the form of a ſervant, is become a ſervant to us. It is the <hi>Perſon</hi> that humbles himſelf, it is the <hi>Perſon</hi> that <hi>obeys,</hi> it is the <hi>Perſon</hi> that ſuffers in and by the humane nature aſſumed. <hi>Actions belong to perſons.</hi> Now that ſo great a Perſon as the Son of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:99997:96"/>God was, ſhould become a <hi>Servant,</hi> a ſervant not only to the Father, but to us: what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of humility is this! that the <hi>God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> ſhould come down from Heaven to <hi>ſerve:</hi> what an inſtance of humility is this! It is <hi>Calvins</hi> obſervation upon <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation, or he emptied himſelf.</hi> This expreſſion is to be underſtood of <hi>whole</hi> Chriſt, <hi>as he is God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> though this agrees to him in reſpect of his humane nature only. For we muſt know, that whereas there is but one perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of both natures, he that was the Son of God, truly and really God equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did yet <hi>contain</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> in the <hi>rays</hi> of his own glory, whenas in our fleſh he did take upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant;</hi> this <hi>humility</hi> of Chriſt ſhould teach us <hi>great humility.</hi> And the Apoſtle preſſeth <hi>humility</hi> upon us on this very account: <hi>Let the ſame mind be in you that was in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> how ſo? <hi>who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and was made in the likeneſs of men, and being found in faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf and became obedient.</hi> Here is the great <hi>Pattern</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, ſaith the Apoſtle, he who was in the <hi>form of God,</hi> took upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant:</hi> he that was <hi>above all obedience,</hi> took upon him to be <hi>obedient.</hi> Should Chriſt, who was in ſuch a height of excellency, ſo debaſe himſelf as to take upon him the form of a ſervant, and become obedient, and ſhould we lift up our ſelves? How unlike doth this make us to our Head? Let us ſtudy the great condeſcenſion and abaſement of <hi>God incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> who though he were Lord of all, yet put
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:99997:97"/>himſelf into the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> to obey and ſerve for us, and then ſee whether there is ſuch reaſon we ſhould think ſo highly of our ſelves, ſtand ſo much upon our own dignity and honour. Chriſt was content to <hi>lay aſide</hi> his honour, and to have the glory of the Divinity unſeen for a time, that he might be a ſervant to the Father and to us in working out our Salvation. If we would be like our Lord and Head, we ought to be content to lay aſide our own honour and glory, if we may any way be ſerviceable to him or his intereſt. The <hi>humility</hi> of Chriſt ſhould teach us <hi>great humility.</hi>

                  <p>I Mentioned a third Propoſition, wherein the love of Chriſt, in being made under the Law, did appear, and ſhall now proſecute it a little further.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The love of Chriſt in being made under the Law appears in this, That Chriſt took upon him the whole debt of obedience which the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Now there are two things which the Law of God requires of us. 1. The <hi>Law</hi> requires <hi>habitual purity and ſanctity of nature.</hi> 2. The <hi>Law</hi> requires <hi>actual obedience</hi> to whatſoever is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by it. 1. The Law of God requires from the creature <hi>habitual purity</hi> and <hi>ſanctity of nature;</hi> God <hi>made man upright;</hi> man was created at firſt in a ſtate of <hi>Integrity.</hi> Man in his original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution had not the leaſt inclination to any thing that was evil, but mans will and affections in their primitive conſtitution were inclined to good. It is true, man had <hi>liberty</hi> of will, and it was <hi>poſſible</hi> for him to ſin, otherwiſe he had never ſinned; but man was not, in his original con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as he was firſt framed by God, <hi>inclined</hi> to the leaſt evil, nay man had that rectitude put upon all his faculties, as that in reſpect of
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:99997:98"/>his <hi>original conſtitution,</hi> his nature was ſo framed by God, as that it was <hi>ſet</hi> and inclined to do that which was good; for otherwiſe it could not have been ſaid of man, as it was ſaid of all the other Works of God, that <hi>God beheld all the things which he had made, and behold they were all good, very good.</hi> If man had not been made with ſuch a frame and conſtitution at firſt, as that he had not the leaſt inclination to evil, but that he was framed and made ſo, as that he was fitted to do good; it could not be ſaid of man, as of other the Works of God, That they were good: but God made all things very good, ſo alſo did he make man. Man was made <hi>upright</hi> according to the Image of God, and this is that which is commonly called <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Righteouſneſs.</hi> Man was indued at firſt with <hi>original righteouſneſs:</hi> now God creating man in ſuch a ſtate of <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> at firſt, he doth ſtill require that <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> from man in which he was at firſt created; for God may juſtly expect that from man which firſt he gave him. God created him in a ſtate of Purity, and God expects man ſhould <hi>retain</hi> that purity in the <hi>inward frame</hi> and <hi>diſpoſition of his heart.</hi> And therefore <hi>Divines</hi> obſerve, As <hi>Original ſin</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, ſo <hi>Original righteouſneſs</hi> is commanded in the laſt Commandment, when it is ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> 2. The Law requires <hi>actual obedience</hi> to whatſoever is commanded by it. The <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of the Law ſpeaks on this wiſe, <hi>That the man that doth theſe things ſhall live by them, Rom.</hi> 10.5. The Law requires that there ſhould be a <hi>doing,</hi> an <hi>actual performance</hi> of the things that are commanded by it: and the Law ſaith, <hi>Curſed is every one that continues not in all things that are
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:99997:98"/>written in the book of the Law to do them, Gal.</hi> 3.10. Now our Saviour ſums up the duty of the Moral Law in thoſe two <hi>great Precepts;</hi> the firſt is, <hi>That we ſhould love the Lord our God with all the heart, and with all the ſoul, and with all the mind:</hi> and the ſecond is, <hi>That we ſhould love our neighbour as our ſelf, Mark</hi> 12.30. Now Chriſt being made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law for us, took upon him all this <hi>debt</hi> of obedience which the Law required of us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Whereas the Law of God requires <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> of nature, the Lord Jeſus aſſuming our nature, <hi>adorns</hi> and inveſts it with all that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual purity and ſanctity which the Law of God requires. Hence was it, that Chriſt took up our nature without ſin, brought original righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into it, and hath preſerved it in a ſtate of purity all along. Chriſts Conception and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity were without ſin; therefore is he ſaid to be that <hi>holy thing</hi> which ſhould be born of the Virgin, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35. The <hi>inward diſpoſitions</hi> of Chriſts ſoul were ſuch as the Law of God required to be; therefore is the Law ſaid <hi>to be in his heart, Pſal.</hi> 40.8. And in general it is ſaid of him, that he was <hi>holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, Heb.</hi> 7.26. That <hi>in him was no ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. That he was a <hi>Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. All theſe things ſpeak the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Sanctity of his nature, that Chriſt in the inward frame of his nature anſwered that habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual purity the Law of God required and called for.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas the Law required actual obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to what is commanded by it, Chriſt being <hi>made under the Law</hi> for us, left no part of the Law unfulfilled. Chriſt did perfectly perform in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:99997:99"/>
                     <hi>thought, word,</hi> and <hi>deed</hi> what the Law command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He fulfilled the Law as to every branch of it: this we heard before, that not <hi>one iota or tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Law was to paſs away till all was fulfilled.</hi> All was perfectly and exactly fulfilled by Chriſt. Hence is it, that he is called the <hi>holy One, and the Juſt, Acts</hi> 3.14. Hence alſo is it, that he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth the Jews, <hi>Which of you can accuſe me of ſin, Joh.</hi> 8.46. And it was propheſied of him before, <hi>That he had done no violence, neither was any deceit found in his mouth, Iſa.</hi> 53.9. Chriſt performed all duties towards God, and all duties towards man. 1. For duties <hi>towards God.</hi> He loved his <hi>Father</hi> perfectly, feared him perfectly, obeyed him perfectly. Hence is it ſaid of him, <hi>He always did the things that were pleaſing in his ſight, Joh.</hi> 8.29. And therefore when he came to dye he could ſay, <hi>I have glorified thee on earth, I have finiſhed the work that thou gaveſt me to do, Joh.</hi> 17.4. 2. As for duties <hi>towards man,</hi> Chriſt was ſo exact in all moral Righteouſneſs, that in the matter of paying <hi>Tribute,</hi> though he knew he was not in ſtrictneſs bound to it, yet to prevent offence, and avoid all appearance of evil, he would work a Miracle rather than leave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.24.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Propoſition to illuſtrate the greatneſs of the love of Chriſt in being made under the Law for us is this, Chriſt having taken upon him the whole debt of obedience which the Law required, <hi>perſevered and continued in the courſe of his obedience till all was finiſhed.</hi> Hence is it ſaid of him, <hi>He became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs, Phil.</hi> 2.8. Chriſt was obedient <hi>all along,</hi> his obedience laſted through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:99997:99"/>his whole life, he was <hi>obedient unto death.</hi> It is an emphatical expreſſion, <hi>He was obedient unto death:</hi> that is, his obedience <hi>continued through the courſe of his life,</hi> and continued <hi>unto death,</hi> and his death was <hi>the laſt act of his obedience.</hi> Hence was it, when our Saviour came to dye, he uſed this ſpeech, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> He had finiſhed all that obedience which the Law had required, and his Father had injoyned him. The Law requires <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, perpetual</hi> obedience, as well as <hi>perfect</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. The Law requires obedience, not only in one time and ſeaſon, but in the whole of our life. Now there was no <hi>failing</hi> in any part of Chriſts obedience to the law at any time. He was never found guilty of any ſin in the whole courſe of his life. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9. <hi>In him was found no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</hi> And as he was never found guilty of the leaſt ſin, ſo he <hi>perſevered</hi> in all acts of obedience to the laſt. Hence is it ſaid, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.34. <hi>His meat and drink was to do the will of him that ſent him, and to finiſh his work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth Propoſition is. The greatneſs of Chriſts love in being made under the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, In that what Chriſt did in a way of obedience to the Law, it was <hi>for us.</hi> Hence is it ſaid, that Chriſt is made <hi>ſin for us,</hi> and <hi>we</hi> are made the <hi>righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Chriſt took upon him <hi>our perſon,</hi> Chriſt ſuſtained the perſons <hi>of all the Elect,</hi> Chriſt did that for us which we ſhould have done. Hence is it, that Chriſt is ſaid to be the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> The obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which Chriſt performed to the Father was in <hi>our name,</hi> in <hi>our room,</hi> in <hi>our ſtead.</hi> Hence is it ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>is the end of the Law for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.4.</note> The meaning is, Chriſt performed that <hi>righteouſneſs for us</hi> which the law required <hi>of us.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay, That Chriſt firſt <hi>merited for himſelf,</hi> and then for us; but this is a very fond Opinion. What need had Chriſt to merit any thing for himſelf, who was Lord of all things? Chriſt needed nothing for himſelf, all that he did and ſuffered was for us. The end of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> and being <hi>made man</hi> was for us: <hi>To us a Son is born, to us a Child is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Iſa.</hi> 9.6. The end of <hi>Chriſts being made under the Law</hi> was <hi>for us:</hi> he was made under the law <hi>to redeem them that were under the law,</hi> as the Text tells us. The end of his <hi>Sufferings</hi> was <hi>for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh.</hi> The end of his Reſurrection was <hi>for us,</hi> who was <hi>delivered for our offences,</hi> and was <hi>raiſed again for our juſtification, Rom.</hi> 4.25. The end of his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> and <hi>Glorification</hi> was for us. Hence is it ſaid, <hi>The glory which thou gaveſt unto me, I have given unto them, Joh.</hi> 17.22. Hence alſo are we ſaid <hi>to be ſet together in heavenly places with Chriſt, Eph.</hi> 2.6. Chriſt never ſought any thing for himſelf, nor received any thing for himſelf, but he received all things for us.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:99997:101"/>righteouſneſs</hi> which Chriſt hath in himſelf, is made ours by <hi>true application</hi> and <hi>imputation.</hi> Chriſts <hi>own righteouſneſs,</hi> that <hi>righteouſneſs which inheres in</hi> Chriſts own perſon is made ours by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> and <hi>application.</hi> Hence is it ſaid in the Text mentioned before, <hi>Christ is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to them that believe, Rom.</hi> 10.3. The meaning is, Chriſt anſwers <hi>that</hi> end of the Law, ſo as by his obedience to bring in that <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> whereby we may be <hi>juſtified</hi> and <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted</hi> of God.

This is clear from that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. <hi>If Abraham were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</hi> The meaning of that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is, If <hi>Abraham</hi> did good works, thoſe good works might be <hi>praiſe worthy</hi> and <hi>commendable</hi> in the ſight of man, but they were not of that <hi>value</hi> and <hi>worth</hi> as to procure his <hi>Juſtification in the ſight of God. Abrahams</hi> beſt works were too ſhort to juſtifie him before God; therefore it is Chriſts obedience, that is, that which God <hi>tooks upon</hi> in the point of Juſtification, is his righteouſneſs, and that only. Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>He hath brought in everlaſting righteouſneſs,</hi> and he is the <hi>Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> Hence alſo is that expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.12. <hi>The Prieſthood being chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,

The great relief as to this, is, that Chriſt was <hi>made under the Law, and he hath perfectly fulfilled it.</hi> Though thou comeſt far ſhort of what the law requires; yet if thou beeſt a Believer, thou art accepted in the <hi>compleat Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt; although thy obedience is <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>ſhort,</hi> and is no way ſuch, upon the account of which God ſhould accept thee, yet thou art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in Chriſt who is thy Head, who hath wrought out a compleat obedience for thee. Hence is it ſaid, <hi>We are compleat in him, Col.</hi> 2.10. God, when he accepts thy perſon, doth not look upon <hi>what thou haſt done,</hi> but upon <hi>what Chriſt hath done. Chriſt is the end of the law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> If thou be a Believer, God conſiders thee according to what thou art in Chriſt, and not according to what thou art in thy ſelf: he conſiders <hi>Chriſts obedience,</hi> not thy <hi>obedience.</hi> Not but that a Believer is ſtill <hi>bound</hi> to obedience, and the law is ſtill a <hi>rule</hi> of obedience to him, but in the point of Juſtification God hath reſpect to Chriſts obedience, not to our obedience. Our obedience at the beſt is but imperfect obedience;
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:99997:103"/>and therefore God in juſtifying his people, hath reſpect to the obedience of his Son. Thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt infinitely ſhort of fulfilling the law; but if thou be a Believer, thou art reputed in Chriſt as having fulfilled the law. Hence is the law ſaid to be fulfilled <hi>in us, Rom.</hi> 8.4. <hi>That the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the law never was, nor can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fulfilled in and by any individual Believer; but it is fulfilled for us in a part of our nature, the righteouſneſs of the law is fulfilled in Chriſt our Head. Chriſt hath perfectly obeyed the law for us in a part of our nature, and ſo the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law is fulfilled in us, that is, it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in Chriſt who bare our nature, and ſo (by imputation) in us. It is <hi>Davenants</hi> obſervation: When I am called to account, and the whole debt of obedience the law requires is exacted from me, a Believer muſt then ſhew his <hi>Surety,</hi> and ſay, Behold here is my Surety which hath paid my debt, and therefore I am free, and the <hi>hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that was againſt me is blotted out, Col.</hi> 2.14. This is the great and only relief to the people of God in reference to their infirmities. We ought to aſpire and breathe after the moſt perfect, yea, if it were poſſible, the moſt <hi>Angelical</hi> obedience; but when we have done all, we ſhall find we are ſtill <hi>unprofitable ſervants,</hi> and come infinitely ſhort of what was our duty and of what the law requires: but here is our relief, that Chriſt is the <hi>end of the law for righteouſneſs,</hi> he hath ſo anſwered that end of the law, as to bring in that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which muſt juſtifie us. God in Juſtification <hi>imputes righteouſneſs without works, Rom.</hi> 4.6. God hath no conſideration of our <hi>works and obedience
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:99997:104"/>in the matter of Juſtification,</hi> but he reſpects the <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>ſingly.</hi> Therefore though we find our ſelves <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> and <hi>ungodly,</hi> yet we may believe in him that <hi>juſtifies the ungodly,</hi> as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. When we are ſo far from having any ſenſe of a righteouſneſs that we nay appear before God withal, as that we have a great deal of guilt which troubleth our conſcience; yet we may look to a righteouſneſs without us, and ſee the law fulfilled and ſatisfied for us in Chriſt our Head. But here let me give this caution, Take heed of <hi>abuſing</hi> this Doctrine. The end of this Doctrine is not to make men <hi>looſe</hi> and <hi>licentious,</hi> as that men ſhould reaſon thus with themſelves, Chriſt hath fulfilled the law for us, and therefore it is no matter how we live, Chriſt hath done all, and therefore it matters not what we do; this is to <hi>turn the grace of God into wantonneſs.</hi> And the Doctrine of <hi>free Grace</hi> doth not in <hi>it ſelf</hi> teach any ſuch thing, but the <hi>corruption</hi> of man makes this ill uſe of this Doctrine. The Doctrine of the Goſpel teaches another thing. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation teacheth us, that denying all ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent evil world, Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. The end of this Doctrine is not to be an incouragement to <hi>ſecurity,</hi> but to <hi>relieve afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſciences.</hi> Chriſt came to <hi>heal the broken in heart;</hi> and if there be any ſuch who are <hi>conſcious</hi> to themſelves of their daily infirmities, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the many failings they are guilty of in all they do, go mourning under their failings and imperfections, this Doctrine concerns them. Chriſt hath undertaken to anſwer the Law as a

                     <hi>Covenant of Works;</hi> though the law be ſtill a rule of obedience, yet Chriſt hath performed it as a <hi>Covenant of Works.</hi> That <hi>perfect, exact, compleat</hi> obedience the law requires, Chriſt hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it in our name and ſtead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If Chriſt was <hi>made under the Law,</hi> let us learn to admire and adore the <hi>height, depth, breadth,</hi> and <hi>length</hi> of the love of God in Chriſt. God <hi>in Chriſt</hi> is become the <hi>ſole Author</hi> of mans Salvation. God in Chriſt hath done that <hi>for us</hi> which we never <hi>did do,</hi> nor <hi>could do</hi> for our ſelves. Chriſt hath <hi>fulfilled the Law</hi> for us, and wrought out that righteouſneſs for us, which we could never work out for our ſelves.

                  <p>OUR Saviour having exhorted his Diſciples to <hi>love one another,</hi> and having propounded his <hi>own</hi> love as a <hi>motive</hi> and as a pattern to them to induce them to love one another; <hi>This is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you:</hi> He comes in this verſe to ſhew us what that love of his to his people was, and wherein the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of that love did manifeſt it ſelf. Therefore it is well obſerved by <hi>Grotius</hi> upon this Text, That our Saviour doth here explain what it is that he means by that expreſſion in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe, <hi>As I have loved you.</hi> This is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, that ye ſhould love one another, <hi>as I have loved you.</hi> The pattern of your love each to other ought to be my love to you, <hi>as I have loved you.</hi> Now if you deſire to know how it is that I have loved you, I will plainly declare it to you, I am ready to offer up my life a Sacrifice for you. This certainly is the higheſt demonſtration of love that can be on my part; my love to you is ſuch, as that I am ready to lay down my life for you; ſuch ought your love to be one towards another, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:99997:105"/>
                  <p>This I take to be the plain coherence of theſe words. In the words themſelves we have two Aſſertions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Aſſertion is this, That Chriſt hath laid down his life for his people, or for <hi>his friends.</hi> This is clearly implied, <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> But I intend to lay down my life for you, or I am ready to lay down my life for you: this is the <hi>Minor Propoſition,</hi> as we call it, that is neceſſarily implied.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major Propoſition</hi> is expreſly laid down, <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> But I have laid down my life for you, or I am ready to lay down my life for you: this is the minor Propoſition that is neceſſarily implied; for otherwiſe the Argument of our Saviour here in the Text would have no force in it. The ſcope of our Saviour in the Text is to perſwade his Diſciples <hi>to love one another</hi> upon the account of his love to them; and he lays down this as the main Propoſition, That it is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love for any man to lay down his life for his friend. Now unleſs the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> be ſuppoſed, That Chriſt hath laid down his life for us, the Argument would fall to the ground and come to nothing; therefore this is ſuppoſed, and this is the <hi>minor Propoſition</hi> neceſſarily to be underſtood, That Chriſt hath laid down his life for his friends, <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that he lay down his life for his friends.</hi> But this is my love to you, I have thus laid down my life for you, I am juſt now about to do it, and therefore 'tis as certain as if it were already done: this muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:99997:106"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Aſſertion is, That Chriſts lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his life for his friends, is the higheſt demonſtration of love: <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that he lay down his life for his friends.</hi> Our Saviour ſpeaks here after the manner of men, he ſpeaks of that which is the higheſt love among men. The higheſt love among men is, when one man is ready to lay down his life for another. Now, ſaith our Saviour, I am ready to lay down my life for you; it is the work I am now going about; I am now going to lay down my life for you, and therefore my love to you is the higheſt and greateſt love.</p>
                  <p>From theſe two Aſſertions there are theſe two Propoſitions that do naturally ariſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label>
                     <hi>That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath laid down his life for his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label>
                     <hi>That the love of Chriſt in laying down his life for us, was the higheſt demonſtration of love. Greater love than this hath no man, that he lay down his life for his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To begin with the firſt of theſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Propoſition then is this, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label>
                     <hi>That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath laid down his life for his people.</hi> This, my Beloved, is a point of great weight and moment, and there are many things of great weight and moment that will neceſſarily fall in in ſpeaking to it. In the Explication of this Point, I ſhall proceed in this Method.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall ſhew what the import of this Phraſe is, what it is for a man <hi>to lay down his life</hi> for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew how it was that Chriſt laid down his life for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I ſhall ſhew how it is ſaid, that Chriſt laid
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:99997:106"/>down his life for his friends; whenas elſewhere it is ſaid, that Chriſt dyed for us <hi>whilst we were enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. I ſhall take occaſion from this Text to ſpeak ſomething concerning the Doctrine of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> I have already treated of the Love of Chriſt, (1) In his <hi>Incarnation:</hi> (2) Of the Love of Chriſt in his <hi>being made under the Law for us.</hi> And when I firſt undertook to ſpeak to thoſe Heads, there were two more I had in my thoughts to ſpeak to; the one was to ſpeak of the Love of Chriſt in his <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and the other was to ſpeak of the Love of Chriſt in his <hi>Interceſſion;</hi> and now I ſhall take occaſion from this Text to treat of that Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Love</hi> of Chriſt in his <hi>Satisfaction: Greater love than this hath no man, that he lay down his life for his friends.</hi> It is one main demonſtration of Chriſts love to us, That he hath laid down his life for us. But firſt I ſhall begin to open this Phraſe, what the import of this Phraſe is, what it is to lay down a mans life for another, and then I ſhall ſhew how it was that Chriſt laid down his life for us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What is the import of this Phraſe, what doth it ſignifie for <hi>a man to lay down his life</hi> for another? <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that he lay down his life.</hi> If we would go about to tranſlate it exactly according to the letter, we might render it,

                        </gap>, ut quiſpiam animam ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ponat ſive depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat.</note> 
                     <hi>That a man lay down his ſoul for his friends.</hi> It is an <hi>Hebrew Phraſe,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> is put for the <hi>life,</hi> which is the effect of the Souls pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or being in the body. It is the preſence of the Soul that cauſeth life, take away the Soul and life ceaſeth; and therefore it is that the Soul is put for life: ſo that <hi>to lay down a mans ſoul,</hi> which
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:99997:107"/>is the <hi>Phraſe</hi> here uſed, it is to lay down a mans life for another. The import of this Phraſe is no more than we, in our ordinary way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are wont to expreſs thus, it is for a man to be <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>ready</hi> to <hi>dye</hi> for another. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.37. <hi>I will lay down my life for thy ſake.</hi> It is the ſame Phraſe, as in the Text, <hi>I will lay down my life for thy ſake:</hi> that is, I am rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to dye for thee. So 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>We ought to lay down our lives for the brethren:</hi> that is, we ought to be ready to dye for them, if the caſe ſo requires. So that Chriſts laying down his life for us, is no more than his voluntary undergoing of death for us, his giving up himſelf to dye for us.</p>
                  <p>But here we muſt inquire a little, before we go any farther, what was that life which our Saviour was willing to lay down for us: <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that he lay down his life for his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It was his <hi>corporal</hi> life, the life of his humanity, or his life as he was man; for as for the life of his Divinity, that was not poſſible for him to lay down. As he was God, ſo he lives al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and could not dye: as he was God, he was above the power of death. It is true, that perſon who was God aſſumed our nature, and according to that nature he dyed, he laid down the life of his Humanity, but ſtill he retained the life of his Divinity. This our Saviour himſelf explains, and it is a great Text, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. <hi>Therefore doth my Father love me, becauſe I lay down my life, that I may take it again. No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf:</hi> and then it follows, <hi>I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:99997:107"/>it again.</hi> Chriſt had power to lay down his life; this he had not had, if he had been a meer man: no meer man hath power to lay down his own life; every mans life, that is but a meer man, is under the power of God, it is at Gods diſpoſe and not at his own, and no man may diſpoſe of his own life till God, who gave him his life, give him a command and call him to lay it down; and therefore they who are <hi>ſelf-murderers,</hi> and would take away their own lives, do violate the Law of their Creation, they put that in their own power which God alone hath a power over: they take upon them to diſpoſe of their own lives, which God alone, who is their Creator and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord, hath power to diſpoſe of; for none but he that gave us our lives, hath a power and right to diſpoſe of them. But now Chriſt was God as well as Man, and therefore Chriſt had a right to diſpoſe of his own life: <hi>I have power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> Chriſt, as he was God, being the <hi>Author, Conſerver,</hi> and <hi>Maintainer</hi> of his own life; as he was Man, had power to diſpoſe of that life: and this was his love to us, that he laid down his life for us, which he had power to diſpoſe of.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the ſecond thing, and that is, to ſhew you <hi>how</hi> it was that Chriſt laid down his life for us. This I ſhall open to you in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt is ſaid to lay down his life for us, in that he was <hi>ready</hi> to do it. He did not refuſe to part with his life for us, but was moſt ready to give it up for our ſakes. <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that he lay down his life for his friends:</hi> that is, greater love than this hath no man, that
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:99997:108"/>he is <hi>ready</hi> to lay down his life for his friends: he is certainly the beſt friend, who is ready to venture and hazard his life for his friend. Such a friend was Chriſt, he was ready to offer and give up his life for our ſakes. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He counted not his life dear to him, ſo he might finiſh his courſe with joy, and the miniſtry which he had received of the Lord Jeſus, Act.</hi> 20.24. And in another place he ſaith, <hi>He was ready not to be bound only, but alſo to dye at Jeruſalem for the Name of our Lord Jeſus, Act.</hi> 21.13. So this was much more true of Chriſt, he counted not his <hi>life dear</hi> to him, but was ready to offer it up for our ſakes. <hi>I am the good ſhepherd,

                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, mortem non defugere.</note> that the Phraſe <hi>to lay down a mans life,</hi> ſignifies, not to <hi>decline</hi> death, not to <hi>ſhun</hi> death. Chriſt is the good Shepherd, he doth not refuſe to dye for the preſervation of his ſheep. It is ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> that they were men that had <hi>hazarded their lives for the Name of the Lord Jeſus, Act.</hi> 15.25. <hi>They had hazarded their lives.</hi> The words in the <hi>Original</hi> are, <hi>They had delivered up their ſouls,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that is, <hi>their lives:</hi> their lives were not actually taken from them; but the meaning is, they carried their lives in their hands, they were ready to give them up, they often put their lives in hazard, they were ready to have parted with them: ſo Chriſt was ready to expoſe and give up his life for the good of his people. This is one thing, but the leaſt thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Particular for clearing of it is this, Chriſt did <hi>freely</hi> and of his <hi>own accord give up his life</hi> and <hi>ſubject</hi> himſelf to death, when there
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:99997:108"/>was no neceſſity of nature, nor violence from men that could have compelled him thereunto. To underſtand this we muſt know, That all other men, beſides Chriſt, being found ſinners, were under a <hi>Law of death</hi> by reaſon of ſin: <hi>For by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin,</hi> Rom. 5.12. <hi>And the wages of ſin is death, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> But now it was otherwiſe with Chriſt, Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a <hi>Sinner,</hi> and his Humanity being united to the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, he was exempt from the power of death and all manner of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, any further than he in a way of <hi>voluntary condeſcenſion</hi> was pleaſed to ſubject himſelf to death and ſufferings. This our Saviour plainly declares to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.15. <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep:</hi> and more fully <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf.</hi> The Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in Chriſt could, if it had pleaſed, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the humane nature from death and all manner of ſuffering; but ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I lay it down of my ſelf,</hi> when no man could have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my life without my permiſſion, yet I did freely and of my own accord give up my life. It is poſſible that one man may venture his life, and expoſe himſelf to death for another; but then he that doth ſo venture his life for another, muſt otherwiſe firſt or laſt have dyed according to the courſe of Nature. But now it was not thus with Chriſt, there was no neceſſity of Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling Chriſt to dye, but only upon ſuppoſition of his own <hi>free condeſcenſion.</hi> It is true, Chriſt was born a <hi>mortal man,</hi> ſubject to ſuffering and death, as we are, but that was only his own <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary</hi> ſubmiſſion and <hi>condeſcenſion.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Voluntar ſubmiſſio.</hi> Calvin.</note> For look upon the <hi>fleſh</hi> of Chriſt as it was perſonally united
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:99997:109"/>to the <hi>Word</hi> the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> in <hi>Trinity,</hi> ſo that fleſh of his (ſetting aſide the conſideration of his own voluntary ſubjecting of it to death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering) I ſay that fleſh of his, by means of its uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the <hi>Word</hi> the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> in Trinity, had been <hi>immortal</hi> and impaſſible, and by reaſon of that union <hi>immortality</hi> was <hi>due</hi> to it; but it was for our ſakes, and the ſheeps ſake, which he dyed for, that he made himſelf paſſible and mortal: I ſay it was for the ſheeps ſake, that he that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſible and immortal, made himſelf paſſible and mortal. Hence is that expreſſion of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Impaſſibilis Deus non dedignatus eſt eſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo paſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalis, mortis legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſubja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</hi> Leo.</note> 
                     <hi>The impaſſible God did not diſdain to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a paſſible man, and he that was immortal to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject himſelf to the Laws of death.</hi> Chriſt, in the time of his death and ſuffering, did ſo far ſuſpend the virtue of his Divinity, as that the glory and virtue of his Divinity did not extend it ſelf ſo far to his fleſh as to keep him from ſuffering and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is true, the power of the Divinity ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Chriſt in dying; therefore is it ſaid, that <hi>By the power of the Eternal Spirit he offered himſelf without ſpot to God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note> but it did not hinder him from dying. If the glory and virtue of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity had exerted it ſelf fully in Chriſt, it would have kept him from death and all manner of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering. But ſuch was the love of Chriſt to us, that the Divinity in Chriſt ſuſpended its virtue ſo far, that Chriſt might be in a capacity to ſuffer and dye for us. And if you weigh and ponder theſe things, you may well cry out, <hi>O the depths!</hi> O the depths of Chriſts love!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Particular is this, The <hi>Heart of Chriſt</hi> was much in this work. As Chriſt was ready and prepared to dye, and what he did was
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:99997:109"/>free and voluntary, of his own accord, without any neceſſity compelling him thereunto, but what he voluntarily brought himſelf under; ſo the heart of Chriſt was much ſet upon this work of laying down his life for us. <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> Heb. 10.7. <hi>I have a Baptiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed! Luk.</hi> 12.50. The Heart and Spirit of Chriſt, as he was man, was moſt intent upon this work, yea there was the concourſe of both his Wills, his Divine and humane will in laying down his life for us. Here I ſhall ſhew a little, how there was the concourſe of both Chriſts <hi>Wills,</hi> his <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> will, in this work.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt as man according to his <hi>humane</hi> will, was <hi>willing</hi> to ſuffer and dye for us. For though he prayed, <hi>Father, ſave me from this hour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 12.27.</note> and thereby ſhewed the verity and truth of our nature in him, and the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the ſufferings he was to undergo; yet preſently he adds in the very next words, <hi>Nevertheleſs for this end came I to this hour:</hi> hereby plainly declaring, that although the Verity of humane nature, which was in him, had a natural averſneſs in it from ſuffering; yet ſuch was his love to the Father and to our Salvation, that that love overcame that <hi>inclination</hi> of nature, if I may ſo call it, or that natural averſneſs rather which was in humane nature <hi>from</hi> ſuffering, <hi>Save me from this hour, for this end came I to this hour.</hi> Though Nature would have <hi>abhorred</hi> ſuffering and ſpared it ſelf, take it as to its <hi>natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>tendency,</hi> yet ſuch was his love to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and us, that it made him lay aſide the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of Nature, and to break through that natural averſneſs that was in humane nature from ſuffering.</p>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:99997:110"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt, who was God as well as true man, according to his Divine will was willing to dye and ſuffer even in that nature of ours which he had aſſumed. The <hi>Divinity did not</hi> ſuffer, <hi>could not</hi> ſuffer; but the perſon who was God as well as man, according to his Divine will as well as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humane will, was willing to ſuffer and dye in that nature of ours which he aſſumed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. <hi>For their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelf.</hi> For what was it that Chriſt was ſanctified? he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf to be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our ſins, he ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himſelf by his Death and Sufferings, ſo is this Text generally expounded by <hi>Divines,</hi> I ſanctifie my ſelf to ſuffer: well, but how did Chriſt ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie himſelf? he ſanctified himſelf in that nature in which he ſuffered and dyed: he ſuffered in the <hi>humane name;</hi> therefore it was <hi>in that nature</hi> that he ſanctified himſelf. O but who was the perſon ſanctifying all this while? It was <hi>I, I ſanctifie my ſelf.</hi> None but God can ſay, <hi>I ſanctifie my ſelf:</hi> no meer creature can ſay, I ſanctifie my ſelf; Chriſt therefore that was <hi>God</hi> could ſay, <hi>I ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my ſelf.</hi> Chriſt therefore as he was <hi>God,</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Divine will,</hi> ſanctifies himſelf as man to be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our ſins. Hence is it that we have that expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified, even by the offering up the body of Jeſus once for all. By the which will we are ſanctified.</hi> The <hi>will</hi> here ſpoken of is the <hi>will</hi> of God the Father, as is plain by the Context. Now then this will of the Father and Chriſts <hi>will</hi> as he is God, is one and the ſame; for as the Father and the Son have but <hi>one Eſſence,</hi> ſo they have but <hi>one Will.</hi> Now by the <hi>Divine will,</hi> which is one and the ſame in the Father and the Son, are we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:99997:110"/>ſanctified. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified by the offering up of the body of Jeſus once for all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. It was the Divine will, that the body of Jeſus ſhould be offered up, and Chriſt accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his humane will was willing to offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up; for the Son being in our nature, ſpeaks to the Father after this ſort, <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will:</hi> ſo that, as I ſaid, there was the concourſe of both wills in Chriſt, the humane and Divine will, in offering up himſelf, in laying down his life for us. And this I ſpeak to ſhew how willing, how infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely willing Chriſt was in this work of offering himſelf, and that his heart lay wholly in this work; both his wills, his will as God, and his will as man was ingaged in this work of laying down his life for us.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Particular is this, As Chriſt was ready and willing to give up his life for us, ſo he did <hi>actually</hi> lay down his life for us; <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.24. <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it,</hi> that is, he gave himſelf <hi>actually</hi> for the Church. It was not only in the purpoſe and intention of his heart to do it; but he gave himſelf <hi>actually</hi> for the Church, Chriſt did actually offer up his life a Sacrifice for us: <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Chriſt hath loved us, and given himſelf for us an offering and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour.</hi> In every Sacrifice there is the thing <hi>ſacrificed,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and the <hi>Oblation,</hi> or the offering up of the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> Now Chriſt did <hi>actually offer up</hi> himſelf a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for us. It was not enough that the beaſt to be ſacrificed, was brought to the Altar, but he muſt be <hi>ſlain</hi> there, and <hi>offered up</hi> upon the Altar. Thus Chriſt gave his body to be crucified, and he actually offered himſelf to Divine Juſtice for us:
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:99997:111"/>hence is it ſaid, that <hi>He was delivered up for our offences,

Who was <hi>delivered up,</hi> that is, delivered up to death, delivered up to death and ſuffering by the Fathers will and pleaſure, and by his own voluntary offering up of himſelf. Hence is it that we read of the <hi>offering up of the body</hi> of Jeſus once for all,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the oblation of the body of Jeſus.</hi> Chriſt made an offering or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of himſelf to the Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi> The meaning is, Chriſt hath appeared in our nature to deſtroy and aboliſh ſin by offering up himſelf a Sacrifice for ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt Particular is this, That Chriſt in laying down his life for us, intended it as a <hi>price</hi> and ranſom to expiate and take away the guilt of our ſins. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> the great Adverſaries to <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> cannot bear this. They will not admit that Chriſt laid down his life as a <hi>price</hi> or <hi>ranſom,</hi> or by way of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to atone God for the ſins we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. They tell us indeed, that Chriſt dyed to confirm the Truth which he had preached, and alſo, that his dying and riſing again, and taking poſſeſſion of eternal life, was to give us an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of eternal life, and that we ſhall come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in due time: alſo they tell us, that he dyed for an example, but they will not admit that Chriſt dyed by way of ſatisfaction, or that his death was by way of price and ranſom; but the Scripture is moſt expreſs and full as to this: and I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more fully to it hereafter, only at preſent I ſhall hint a few Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. <hi>The Son of man came not to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:99997:111"/>be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</hi> So likewiſe 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Who gave himſelf a ranſom for all.</hi> Here we have two words <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> The Criticks in the Greek Tongue tell us, that <gap reason="foreign">

We were held captive by Sin and Satan, we were Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in the hands of Divine Juſtice. Now Chriſt gave his life as a price to ſet us free, that is the proper ſignification of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it ſignifies the price of redemption; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is more full and pregnant, that ſignifies a price or ranſom laid down for, or inſtead of another. Chriſt gave <hi>his life</hi> for <hi>our lives:</hi> as the life of the beaſt ſacrificed went for the life of the man, ſo Chriſt gave his life for our lives. Hence is it ſaid, that we are redeemed by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſation received by tradition from our fathers; but with the precious blood of Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> Ye were <hi>redeemed by price or ranſom,</hi> ſo the word ſignifies, the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt was the <hi>Price</hi> that was laid down for our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. What can be more full and expreſs to this purpoſe, than what our Saviour declareth to us, when he ſaith, that he gives his fleſh for the life of the world? <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. <hi>The bread which I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> The Son of God aſſumed our nature, and offered it up, this he calls his <hi>fleſh,</hi> and this he gives for the life of the world, that is, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and procure life for the world. The world
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:99997:112"/>lay dead before, dead in ſin, dead in reſpect of condemnation, the world was obnoxious to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath. Now Chriſt gives his fleſh for the <hi>life of the world,</hi> that is, he gives his fleſh to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the world from that ſtate of condemnation in which it was, and to bring it into reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.17. <hi>God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A word for Application. Hath Chriſt laid down his life for his ſheep?</p>
                  <p>Behold here as in a <hi>Mirroir</hi> the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Love.</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> The Son of God would not only take our nature; but being in our nature, he would lay down his life for us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us.</hi> That perſon who was God and man both, laid down his life <hi>as man</hi> for us, he laid down the life of his humanity for us. But this I may have occaſion to ſpeak to more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>This is matter of infinite comfort and ſupport to poor doubting Chriſtians, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> unto ſuch who have <hi>fled</hi> for <hi>refuge</hi> to the <hi>hope</hi> that is ſet <hi>before</hi> them, and yet have many remaining doubts within them concerning their Salvation, whether they ſhall be ſaved in the concluſion yea or no. That which is matter of comfort to them is this,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt hath laid down his life for them. Now this is certain, Chriſt hath not dyed in vain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth; who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> If thou ſhouldſt be condemned for thy ſins, the guilt of which thou feareſt, whenas thou art a poor Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and haſt fled to Chriſt for refuge, then hath
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:99997:112"/>Chriſt dyed in vain, becauſe the end of Chriſts dying was, that thoſe who believe on him might not periſh. So our Saviour himſelf tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh.</hi> If therefore thou who haſt fled to Chriſt for refuge to ſave thee from the ſtroke of Divine wrath, and from the condemning power of the Law, if thou ſhouldſt periſh, Chriſt hath dyed in vain. If Chriſt hath laid down his life to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe eternal life and Salvation for thee, and thou ſhouldſt go without it who art a poor Believer, and runneſt to him for Salvation, then Chriſt hath dyed in vain. Conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>If righteouſneſs come by the Law, then is Chriſt dead in vain.</hi> If God ſhould put thee to work out a righteouſneſs for thy ſelf, and there were no poſſibility of Salvation but by perfect keeping the Law, then there had been no neceſſity of Chriſts death; but Chriſts death was not in vain, Chriſt dyed to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice for them who could not fulfil the Law for themſelves, and therefore there is ground of hope, that ſuch who have fled to Chriſt for refuge, ſhall not be diſappointed of Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing to comfort doubting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians is, that Chriſt who hath the power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of eternal life to whom he pleaſes, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted poor Believers with a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to eternal life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt, as he is <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Mediator,</hi> hath a power given to him to give eternal life to whom he pleaſeth: <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2. <hi>As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:99997:113"/>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt having this power given to him, hath inveſted Believers with a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. It is a <hi>great Text</hi> to comfort ſuch who are concerned about their Salvation more than any thing elſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29. Chriſt ſpeaking of his ſheep ſaith, <hi>I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never periſh.</hi> If Chriſt hath given them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, how ſhall they be deprived of it? If Chriſt hath given them eternal life, who ſhall take it from them? What Chriſt hath once given, he never takes back again; <hi>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</hi> Chriſt therefore having made over a <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to eternal life unto thoſe that are his ſheep, to all that obey and follow him, they muſt of neceſſity have it. Theſe things may be of uſe to ſupport poor doubting Chriſtians, who are concerned about their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: other men are concerned about their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral intereſts in this world; but the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of ſerious Souls is to ſecure their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now theſe conſiderations may be of great uſe unto ſuch.</p>

                  <p>IN the former Diſcourſe I diſpatched the two <hi>firſt Particulars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. I opened the import of the <hi>Phraſe,</hi> what this <hi>Phraſe</hi> did import, for a man to <hi>lay down his life</hi> for his friend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhewed you how it was that Chriſt laid down his life for us.</p>
                  <p>It remains now that I proceed to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the third thing, and that is this, How is it ſaid that Chriſt laid down his life for his <hi>friends,</hi> whereas elſewhere it is ſaid, that we were <hi>enemies</hi> when Chriſt dyed for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Here it is ſaid, that we were <hi>enemies</hi> when Chriſt dyed for us; and yet in the Text it is ſaid, that Chriſt did lay down his life for his <hi>friends.</hi> How are theſe two to be reconciled?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall lay down ſeveral Particulars for the clearing of this, which alſo are neceſſary to be laid down for the underſtanding of the Text it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain, that by <hi>Nature</hi> we are all <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> unto God, and Chriſt, when he dyed for us, when he laid down his life for us, found us in a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:99997:114"/>ſtate of enmity. Although ſome of the Elect, who then lived when Chriſt ſuffered, were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reconciled to God, yet conſider them and us all by nature, we are enemies unto God, and Chriſt dyed for us when we were enemies: ſo in the Text before, <hi>If when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, Rom.</hi> 5.10. Alſo it appeareth from another Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled in the body of his fleſh through death.</hi> Sin is a plain rebellion againſt God, ſin is a fighting againſt him, a perfect oppoſition to the will of God; ſo oppoſite is the ſinner to Gods will, and ſo much bent upon his own will, that he is angry with God, and hates God, becauſe Gods will croſſes his will. Now when we were ſinners and enemies, when we ſtood in this direct oppoſition and deſiance to God, even then Chriſt dyed for us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. <hi>God commended his love to us, that whilſt we were yet ſinners Chriſt dyed for us.</hi> Thoſe who are called <hi>Sinners</hi> in this verſe, are called <hi>Enemies</hi> in the 10. verſe: <hi>If when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> Every ſinner is an enemy to God, Chriſt therefore dyed for us when we were <hi>enemies:</hi> that is the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Particular to clear the Point in hand, is this: Though we were truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>enemies</hi> unto God, yet in ſome ſenſe God <hi>accounted</hi> us, and <hi>looked upon</hi> us as friends, how ſo? not as being friends to him, but as he being a friend to us; not that we had any <hi>love</hi> or <hi>affection</hi> for God, but that God had <hi>good will</hi> and <hi>kindneſs</hi> for us. It is a great Text to clear this, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:99997:114"/>
                     <hi>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that God loved us, and gave his Son to be the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for our ſins.</hi> Hence is it, that one of the Ancients hath this expreſſion:
<note place="margin">Etſi non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, ſed tamen jam amatis.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>dyed for his friends, although not for ſuch friends as did already love him, yet for ſuch friends as were in ſome ſort beloved by him.</hi> For it was out of his love that he dyed for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Particular to clear it is this, Chriſts <hi>Death</hi> was the means to make us <hi>friends,</hi> and to reconcile us to God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22. <hi>You hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death.</hi> It is a Speech of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">Chriſtus non aliter pro amicis mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus eſt, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi pro acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendis, ſcil. ut amicos faceret ex inimicis.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt did no otherwiſe dye for his friends than that he might make them friends,</hi> that is, <hi>that he might make them friends who were enemies before,</hi> and Chriſts death was <hi>influential</hi> to make us the friends of God, or to reconcile us to him theſe two ways.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt by his death hath <hi>aboliſhed</hi> and taken away the <hi>enmity</hi> that was between God and us. Hence is it ſaid expreſly, that Chriſt hath ſlain the <hi>enmity</hi> by his <hi>Croſs, Eph.</hi> 2.16. <hi>That he might reconcile both in one body by the Croſs, having ſlain the enmity thereby.</hi> That he might reconcile <hi>both,</hi> that is, that he might reconcile both Jews and Gentiles in one body, by the Croſs, that is, by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himſelf upon the Croſs. Having ſlain the <hi>enmity</hi> thereby, that is, having taken away the enemity that was between God and us by the Sacrifice of himſelf upon the Croſs. God was infinitely offended with us by reaſon of ſin: now Chriſt offering himſelf as a Sacrifice upon the Croſs for our ſins, hereupon God is pacified and appeaſed, the enmity that God had againſt us is now ſlain and taken quite away. God hath
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:99997:115"/>now no more againſt us, <hi>There is now no condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 8.1. Now the enmity that was between God and us being ſlain and removed, there is a foundation laid for friendſhip between God and us: whilſt two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons remain unreconciled, they cannot cordially love one another; whilſt the difference remains, there are heats and animoſities, heart burnings one againſt another; but when the difference is taken up, then there is a foundation laid for love and friendſhip. So in this caſe: ſo long as we apprehend that God hath a controverſie with us, that he is angry with us for our ſins, that he is ready to condemn us for them, this drives us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from God, we cannot love him whilſt we are under ſuch apprehenſions; but when we know that God is reconciled by the death of Chriſt, that his Juſtice is ſatisfied, that he will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn us for our ſins, this lays the foundation for friendſhip, then are we ingaged to draw near to God, and to give up our ſelves in ways of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him. Now Chriſt by his death hath ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, and thereby ſlain the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that was between God and us, and ſo laid the foundation of friendſhip between God and us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt by his death hath purchaſed the <hi>ſpirit of regeneration,</hi> which doth renovate and change our hearts, and take away the natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that is in them againſt God, and inclines our hearts unto God. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. <hi>According to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour.</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> is ſhed on us <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:99997:115"/>that is, through the Merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Saviour. It is God that ſheds the Holy Ghoſt into our hearts, but it is through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. It is through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſts death that this Spirit is purchaſed for us. Well! but what doth the Holy Ghoſt do when he is ſent into our hearts as the purchaſe of Chriſts death? He regenerates and renews us. So the former <hi>verſe</hi> tells us, <hi>According to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration and renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> of God takes away the <hi>heart of ſtone,</hi> and gives us a <hi>heart of fleſh.</hi> The Spirit of God working grace in the heart, takes away the enmity and oppoſition that naturally lies in our heart againſt God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines our hearts to love God, and to fear him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Particular we would lay down for the clearing of the Point is this, That our <hi>Saviour</hi> here in the <hi>Text</hi> is ſpeaking of the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> love amongſt men: <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> The <hi>greateſt</hi> love amongſt men will go no higher than this, for one man to lay down his life for another. Now, ſaith our Saviour, you cannot complain that my love is defective towards you, in that I am ready to do as much for you as ever any man did for his friend. The higheſt love that you can inſtance in is, when one man doth lay down his life for another: now I am ready to lay down my life for you; therefore it is that our Saviour ſaith here, <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another Particular for the clearing of it is this, The <hi>Diſciples</hi> to whom Chriſt was here ſpeaking <hi>(Greater love than this hath no man, that
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:99997:116"/>he lay down his life for his friends)</hi> were already made <hi>friends;</hi> but yet they and all others, who were made friends before his incarnation, were made friends to God by virtue of that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which now he was about to offer up. For Chriſt was a <hi>Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> and the virtue of his death and ſufferings was <hi>extended</hi> to all the Saints that were made ſo in all Ages: therefore although they to whom Chriſt was now ſpeaking, were already made friends; yet it was through the virtue of his death and ſufferings, that now he was to undergo, that they were made ſo. All men by nature are enemies alike, and that now any were made friends, was by virtue of the death of Chriſt, that he was to ſuffer and undergo for them. For it was the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crce</hi> of God, that Chriſt ſhould dye and ſuffer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did dye and ſuffer; and it was in the <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> of his ſufferings, that all the Elect that lived <hi>before</hi> his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> and thoſe that lived in the time when he was here in the fleſh, were recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth Particular is this: Chriſt had in the former verſe been exhorting his Diſciples to <hi>love one another,</hi> according to the <hi>Pattern</hi> himſelf had given to them, <hi>This is my commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you.</hi> Now in this verſe he ſhews wherein he did manifeſt his love to them, he was ready to manifeſt his love to them, by <hi>Laying</hi> down his life for them: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they intended to love one another in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his <hi>Pattern,</hi> they muſt be ready to ſhew the higheſt offices of <hi>love one to another.</hi> He would have them love one another, <hi>even as he hath loved them.</hi> His love to them made him wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:99997:116"/>to lay down his life for them; and therefore if they would love in conformity to him, they ſhould be ready to perform the higheſt offices of love one towards another: Hereby perceive we the <hi>love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our Saviour was about to <hi>owne</hi> them as his <hi>friends,</hi> and to acquaint them, that he intended to deal with them as with <hi>friends.</hi> Now it was not <hi>accommodate</hi> to his preſent deſign and ſcope in this place to ſay he would lay down his life for his enemies; for immediately after he tells them, that he owns them for his friends in the 14. verſe, <hi>Ye are my friends, if you do whatſoever I command you. Henceforth I have not called you ſervants, but I have called you friends.</hi> And he tells them, he deals with them as with friends: <hi>The ſervant knoweth not what his Lord doth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you, Joh.</hi> 15.15. Chriſt tells them, that he looked upon them as <hi>friends,</hi> and that he intended to deal with them as <hi>friends;</hi> therefore it was not accommodate with our Saviours preſent ſcope and deſign in this place to uſe the expreſſion of <hi>enemies</hi> (though we were all enemies when Chriſt dyed for us) but he chuſeth to expreſs it thus: <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> Upon theſe accounts I conceive it is in this place that Chriſt ſaith, he laid down his life for his <hi>friends,</hi> whereof elſewhere it is ſaid, we were enemies when Chriſt dyed for us.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I diſpatched the third Particular to ſhew you how it is ſaid, Chriſt laid down his life
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:99997:117"/>for his <hi>friends.</hi> It remains now that I ſhould enter upon the fourth Head, and that is, to ſpeak ſomething concerning the Doctrine of <hi>Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction;</hi> but becauſe I chuſe to reſerve that <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire</hi> to be ſpoken to by it ſelf, I ſhall make ſome Application of what hath been mentioned, and indeed the Uſe that ariſeth from hence is of great moment.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Uſe therefore ſhall be this. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> Doth Chriſt lay down his life for his <hi>friends?</hi> Let us be exhorted from hence to be ſenſible of the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we are in by <hi>nature,</hi> we are not <hi>born</hi> friends, but we are made ſo by the <hi>Death</hi> of Chriſt. We are ſo far from being <hi>born friends,</hi> as that we are <hi>born enemies</hi> unto God: now we ought to be ſenſible of the <hi>natural enmity</hi> that is in us againſt God. But here it may be ſaid, Wherein doth this enemity conſiſt? How doth it appear, that we are enemies unto God? I anſwer, It appears in theſe three Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It appears in this, That our <hi>wills</hi> are moſt oppoſite to the <hi>Will</hi> of God. That natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that is in us againſt God appears in this, <hi>Qui alterius voluntati adverſatur,</hi> ſaith a Learned man, <hi>He that reſiſts and ſets himſelf to croſs the will of another, and doth this always, ſo that his will can by no means conſent or agree to anothers will, he is ſaid to be a mans enemy.</hi> Now ſuch is the will of every natural man: the will of every natural man doth perpetually riſe in oppoſition againſt Gods Will. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. <hi>Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Herein doth the <hi>hoſtility</hi> or <hi>enmity</hi> of the carnal mind diſcover it ſelf, that it <hi>cannot be ſubject to the Law of God.</hi> The carnal
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:99997:117"/>mind always <hi>croſſes</hi> and thwarts the Will of God. Let the Law of God forbid ſuch a ſin, it will not be reſtrained from it. Let the Law of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſuch a Duty, it will not be brought to the performance of it.

                     <hi>It is not ſubjected to the Law of God,</hi> the carnal mind refuſeth to be brought into order. The Law of God would ſet <hi>bounds</hi> to mens <hi>thoughts, wills,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> but they will not be kept within thoſe bounds, whatſoever the Law ſaith to the contrary; they will <hi>think</hi> what they have a mind to <hi>think, covet</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> what they have a mind to <hi>covet</hi> and <hi>deſire, will</hi> what they have a mind to <hi>will;</hi> they will not be kept within thoſe bounds the Law of God hath ſet for them. Now this is that that ſhews the hoſtile diſpoſition that is in corrupt nature againſt God, in that the corrupt mind doth always thwart the Law of God. The Law of God ſaith, ſuch and ſuch ſins are to be avoided, ſuch and ſuch Duties are to be performed; the carnal mind will take no notice either of the one or the other, but thwarts and contradicts the mind and will of God: this diſcovers the natural enmity that is in our hearts againſt God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The natural enmity that is in our hearts diſcovers it ſelf in this, In that naturally men do not only hate the <hi>Will</hi> of God, but they hate <hi>God himſelf.</hi> Mark the expreſſion,

                  <p>You will ſay,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> This is a very <hi>ſevere charge.</hi> Is it poſſible that ever any man ſhould hate God? God is <hi>good,</hi> the <hi>chief good,</hi> yea <hi>goodneſs</hi> it ſelf, how is it poſſible that any man ſhould hate the <hi>chief good?</hi> To this I anſwer, Men do not hate God under that <hi>notion preciſely</hi> as he is <hi>good,</hi> and as he is the <hi>chief good;</hi> but they hate him under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notion, they hate him as he is a <hi>Law-giver,</hi> and as he is a <hi>Judge,</hi> they hate him as he is a holy and <hi>juſt</hi> God, they hate him as his Nature and Will is moſt directly oppoſite to the luſts which they love above any thing in the world. Hence is it ſaid,
<note place="margin">Peccatum eſt Deici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note> that ſin is a kind of <hi>God-murder.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe the ſinner could even wiſh that God were not in Being, that he were removed out of the way, becauſe his Will and his Law ſtand in oppoſition to his luſt. This is another thing wherein the enemity that is in the natural mind againſt God doth diſcover it ſelf, in that men by nature, whilſt they are unreconciled, <hi>hate God himſelf.</hi> Little do men think that there is this <hi>venom</hi> and poyſon in their natures as to hate God, the beſt and moſt excellent Being; yet we are bound to believe the Word of God before what men think or ſay of themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The natural enmity that is in the heart againſt God, is diſcovered in this, In the conſtant <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>tendency</hi> that is in the heart unto <hi>evil, Col.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Enemies in your minds by wicked works.</hi> The mind of a natural man is always ſet upon <hi>evil,</hi> ſometimes it is ſet upon groſs and hainous evils, as <hi>Murder, Adultery, Fornication, Theft, Rapine,</hi> and the like: and when the mind of a natural man is not ſet upon theſe groſſer evils, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſet upon other evils, as <hi>Pride, Self-love, Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:99997:118"/>Covetouſneſs,</hi> and the like. The <hi>enmity</hi> that is in every natural mans mind always diſcovers it ſelf in one of theſe ways: Either by having his affections let out to <hi>groſſer</hi> ſins, or elſe to more <hi>ſpiritual</hi> ſins. Now, faith the Apoſtle, <hi>we are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in our minds by wicked words.</hi> When the mind is violently ſet upon thoſe things which are moſt directly oppoſite to the Nature and Will of God, this is that which doth diſcover the hoſtility and enmity that is in us againſt God. Now it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us all to be deeply ſenſible of this enmity that is in our hearts againſt God. For firſt of all, the more ſenſible we are of this <hi>enmity,</hi> this may be one good means to humble us; what cauſe of <hi>confuſion</hi> ſhould this be to us, that we ſhould not only have a will that doth ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctate againſt Gods Will, againſt the <hi>Divine Will,</hi> and is moſt repugnant to it; but that we ſhould be <hi>enemies</hi> to God <hi>himſelf,</hi> and that we ſhould have a Principle in us that ſhould fight againſt God, and ſtand in direct oppoſition to him?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The more ſenſible we are of this enmity, the more need we ſhall have of <hi>medicinal</hi> and <hi>healing</hi> grace to heal the natural <hi>venom</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity</hi> that is in our natures againſt God.

This was the Errour of ſome of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and ſome of late have fallen into it. But much more true is that of <hi>Auſtin: We may not ſuppoſe, that Salvation is vouchſafed to any man, but to him to whom that one Mediator between God
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:99997:119"/>and man Jeſus Chriſt is divinely revealed. There is no name given under heaven by which we can be ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, Acts</hi> 4.12. And although ſome of the Heathens have pretended, that they have loved God above all things; and ſome of the <hi>corrupter School men</hi> have affirmed, That men by the <hi>power of Nature</hi> may love God above all things; yet if the matter be diligently inquired into, we ſhall certainly find that which <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> obſerved to be moſt true, <hi>Sub illa ſimulata dilectione,</hi> under that <hi>feigned love to God,</hi> which they pretended unto, the greateſt hatred did lye hid. For thoſe very Heathens who ſpoke ſo <hi>highly</hi> and ſo <hi>ſeraphically</hi> of loving God above all things, yet they themſelves were found guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> than which nothing can be more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the true love of God. But the <hi>Divine Oracles</hi> will be found to be moſt true, and they tell us, That the natural mind is <hi>enmity</hi> againſt God, and that thoſe <hi>that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God:</hi> therefore it concerns us all to look after <hi>medicinal Grace</hi> to heal and reſtore our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, otherwiſe that natural enmity that is in us will never be removed.</p>

Chriſt laid down his life for us, not becauſe we were <hi>made</hi> friends before, but to <hi>make</hi> us friends. Since therefore the end of Chriſts death was to reconcile us to God, we ſhould ſeek after reconciliation with him. This is the Apoſtles Argument, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation. Now then we are
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:99997:119"/>Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled to God.</hi> It is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, God is willing to be reconciled to us, and he hath teſtified his willingneſs in giving his Son to dye for our ſins, and making ſatisfaction to his Juſtice. Now ſince God hath expreſſed himſelf to be ſo willing to be reconciled to us, we ought to be willing to be reconciled to him. <hi>We pray you in Chriſts ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it may be inquired, But what is it for us to be reconciled to God? When the Apoſtle prays us here with ſo much earneſtneſs in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God, what is the recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation he aimeth at? how ought we to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God? Two or three things I conceive are here intended.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ought to <hi>ſeek after</hi> reconciliation with God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found,</hi> that is, ſeek his <hi>face</hi> and <hi>favour,</hi> ſeek <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi> with him. Secure ſinners are not aware of the difference that is between God and them; although the ſinner thinks little of it, ſin makes a <hi>vaſt breach,</hi> an hoſtile difference between God and him. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11. And <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, Rom.</hi> 1.18. God doth maintain his controverſie againſt thee whilſt thou goeſt on in the ways of ſin; therefore ſeek recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with him, <hi>Agree with thy adverſary quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whilſt he is in the way, Mat.</hi> 5.25. Labour to take up all differences between God and thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To be <hi>reconciled to God,</hi> is to <hi>accept</hi> of the reconciliation which God tenders, <hi>humbly</hi> to <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace</hi>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:99997:120"/>that grace which God offers. <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world, and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, God hath put himſelf into Chriſt on purpoſe to exhibit and give forth grace and mercy to ſinners, and he ſends his Miniſters and Ambaſſadors on purpoſe to make a tender of grace and mercy to him. Now then <hi>are we reconciled to God</hi> when we do humbly embrace this grace and mercy offered to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. <hi>With the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs.</hi> We ought with the full bent of our affections to embrace the grace of God offered to us in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If we would be reconciled to God, we ought to pray for <hi>renewing</hi> grace, that we may lay aſide the old enmity that lurks in our hearts againſt God. It is ſin that firſt of all made the <hi>quarrel</hi> and <hi>difference</hi> between God and us; and how can we expect in reaſon, that ever we ſhould be brought into perfect reconciliation with God, ſo long as that which firſt bred the quarrel and made the difference between God and us, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained and kept by us?

If therefore we would have the breach made up, and the difference reconciled, we muſt pray for that grace from God, whereby we may lay aſide that which firſt made the quarrel. The Apoſtle tells us, we are <hi>enemies in our minds by evil works, Col.</hi> 1.21. So long as our <hi>minds</hi> are <hi>ſet upon</hi> ſin, ſo long as we continue in the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> of any thing that God hates,

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:99997:120"/>thing. If we would be the friends of God, we muſt <hi>will</hi> what God <hi>wills, hate</hi> what God <hi>hates,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> what God <hi>loves: You that love the Lord hate evil, Pſal.</hi> 97.10.</p>
                  <p>This therefore is the ſecond Uſe, an Uſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to exhort us to ſeek after reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God.</p>
                  <p>In the third and laſt place, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> Learn from what hath been opened, to admire the greatneſs of <hi>Chriſts love to us,</hi> who, in ſome ſenſe, <hi>accounts</hi> us friends, whereas <hi>indeed</hi> we are enemies: <hi>Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> We are all by nature enemies, ſo we have heard, and yet in ſome ſenſe Chriſt accounts us friends. Chriſt had a <hi>purpoſe</hi> of <hi>good will</hi> to us, even when we were enemies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him.

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:99997:121"/>loved the world ſo far, as that he gave his only <hi>begotten Son</hi> to deliver the world from its periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition, and to bring it eternal life: this was the love of God to us; and this <hi>commends</hi> and ſets forth the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of Gods love to us, that when we were <hi>enemies</hi> to him, he had a <hi>kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> for us; and ſo great was his kindneſs to us, that he ſent his <hi>Son</hi> to bring us unto life. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</hi>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE general <hi>Propoſition</hi> that I have laid down as the foundation of our Diſcourſe from theſe words, hath been this, <hi>That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath laid down his life for his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſpeaking to this Doctrine I have propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſpeak to theſe four Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To open the import of this Phraſe, what it is <hi>to lay down a mans life for another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew <hi>how</hi> it was that Chriſt hath laid down his life for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſhew how it is ſaid here in the Text, that Chriſt hath laid down his life for <hi>his friends,</hi> whereas elſe where it is ſaid, that Chriſt dyed for us whilſt we were <hi>enemies.</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I propounded to ſpeak ſomething from hence, concerning the great Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Having already ſpoken ſomething to the three firſt of theſe Particulars, it remains now that I ſhould treat of the Doctrine of Chriſts <hi>Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine much impugned. The <hi>Socinians</hi> deny it altogether; and the <hi>Papiſts</hi> do in a manner ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate this Doctrine, by bringing in other <hi>Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions</hi>
                     <pb n="226" facs="tcp:99997:122"/>beſides that of Chriſt. This Doctrine of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is a Doctrine of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is the great <hi>Pillar</hi> upon which our Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſtands, and the main <hi>Hinge</hi> upon which our <hi>comfort</hi> turns; for if Chriſt have not ſatisfied for us, then are we liable to make ſatisfaction to God in our own perſons.</p>
                  <p>That I may therefore ſpeak ſomething to this <hi>great Doctrine,</hi> I ſhall</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Explain the <hi>name</hi> or <hi>word</hi> a little.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall come to ſpeak to the <hi>thing</hi> it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To explain the <hi>name,</hi> ſome are offended at the <hi>name</hi> it ſelf. As they are offended at the word <hi>Trinity,</hi> and at the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> and at the word <hi>Sacrament,</hi> becauſe they are not <hi>Scripture</hi>-words: ſo ſome have been offended at the word <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> becauſe it is not a Scripture-word. But our Anſwer to this is very plain.</p>
                  <p>Names are but <hi>expreſſive</hi> of things, and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty compels us to think of the moſt proper <hi>names</hi> or <hi>words</hi> to expreſs things by. If therefore the things themſelves be to be found in Scripture, there ſeems very little reaſon why any ſhould reject the names and words that are uſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs thoſe things by. Therefore to touch briefly upon thoſe <hi>words</hi> that ſome have been offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at.</p>
                  <p>Although the word <hi>Trinity</hi> be not found in Scripture, yet the thing it ſelf is certainly found there: <hi>There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. If there be three, then there muſt needs be a <hi>Trinity:</hi> ſo for the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> although we have not the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Scripture in that ſenſe that we commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:99997:122"/>it to a perſon in the Trinity; yet we have another word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. where it is ſaid, Chriſt is the <hi>Character of his Fathers Perſon,</hi> ſo we render it, and indeed the word in the Original is equivalent with the former word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Phavor.</note> and is ſo explained by the ancient Criticks in the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue.</p>
                  <p>So alſo for the third Word mentioned, which was <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Though the word <hi>Sacrament</hi> be not found in Scripture, yet we have ſuch <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations</hi> and <hi>Symbols,</hi> as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> are, to ſignifie and ſet forth ſome ſpiritual Myſteries unto us, and this is what we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the word <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inviſibilis gratiae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</note> A Sacrament is <hi>a viſible ſign of ſome inviſible grace,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it. We muſt have ſome word or other to expreſs things by. So now for this very word that we are here treating of, although we have not the word <hi>Satisfaction</hi> mentioned in Scripture, yet we have the thing it ſelf frequently and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly ſet before us, what elſe is the meaning of thoſe expreſſions, that <hi>God hath laid on him the iniquity of us all,</hi> and that <hi>he hath born the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace, Iſa.</hi> 53.5, 6. If the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhould have been laid on us, was laid on Chriſt, this is properly Satisfaction, what elſe ſhall we call Satisfaction? Now this is clear from that expreſſion, when it is ſaid, <hi>The chaſtifement of our peace was upon him.</hi> Hence alſo it is ſaid, That Chriſt was <hi>made ſin for us,</hi> That he made his <hi>Soul an offering for ſin,</hi> That he <hi>gave his life a ranſom for many.</hi> And there are other places, which I may urge in their proper place; but theſe are enough to ſhew, that the thing it ſelf is in Scripture, and the thing it ſelf being there, there is little reaſon,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:99997:123"/>why any ſhould quarrel at the name or word.</p>
                  <p>Now for the import and ſignification of this word, the <hi>Latine</hi> word <hi>ſatisfacere, to ſatisfie,</hi> the <hi>Criticks</hi> tell us,
<note place="margin">Satisfacere, ſacere quod ſatis alicui ſit, quo ille acquieſcat &amp; conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſit. Satisfacere, eſt tantum facere quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſit ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ad vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictam.</note> That it is <hi>to do that which may be accounted enough by the perſon unto whom it is done, ſo that he may be content with it, and acquieſce in it.</hi> This is the notion of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and in matters of offence they tell us, That <hi>to ſatisfie is to do ſo much as is neceſſary to pacifie the offended perſon in reference to the wrong or injury which he hath ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained.</hi> And thus Chriſt is ſaid to have ſatisfied God, who was angry and offended by reaſon of our ſins, for as much as the <hi>puniſhment</hi> that we had <hi>deſerved</hi> was <hi>transferred</hi> upon Chriſt our <hi>Surety,</hi> and he bearing the <hi>puniſhment for us,</hi> God is hereby <hi>pacified</hi> and <hi>appeaſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the conſideration of the thing it ſelf, and here</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſhall give a deſcription of the nature of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and open the <hi>parts of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi> And then</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall lay down ſeveral Propoſitions for the clearing of the whole Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For a <hi>deſcription</hi> of the nature of Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, we may take a deſcription of it thus. The <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt is one of Chriſts <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial actions,
<note place="margin">A deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</note> particularly an act of his Prieſthood, whereby Chriſt offering up himſelf a facrifice for our ſins, hath made a full compenſation to the Juſtice of God for the ſins of his people, and thereby pacified or turned away Gods wrath, and hath procured pardon of ſin, and eternal life for us.</hi> This deſcription will take in the whole nature of Chriſts Satisfaction. Here we have the ſeveral parts of this deſcription to unfold: and here</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:99997:123"/>
                  <p n="1">1. We muſt ſhew how the Satisfaction of Chriſt is one of Chriſts <hi>Mediatorial actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt ſhew how it is an <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt ſhew what the <hi>matter</hi> of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is, Chriſt <hi>offers himſelf a ſacrifice for our ſins,</hi> ſo we have it in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. What the <hi>form</hi> of this Satisfaction was, Chriſt made a-full <hi>compenſation</hi> to the Juſtice of God for the ſins of his people.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What the <hi>effects</hi> of this Satisfaction are, and they principally three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The turning away of Gods wrath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The obtaining pardon of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The procuring eternal life for us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things explained, will give us ſome light into the nature of Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. We ſay, That the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt is one of Chriſts <hi>Mediatorial actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To underſtand this, we muſt take in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider Chriſt as <hi>one God</hi> with the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſo Satisfaction is made <hi>to him.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Chriſt as <hi>Mediator,</hi> and ſo he is that <hi>Perſon</hi> that makes the Satisfaction. Every ſin is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence committed againſt the <hi>Divine Majeſty.</hi> Now for as much as all the Trinity have the <hi>ſame Eſſence</hi> of the Divinity in them; therefore we muſt of neceſſity ſuppoſe, that when <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is made to one of the Perſons, Satisfaction is made to the other alſo, becauſe they have all one and the ſame Eſſence, and it is the Divine Majeſty that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in all. The <hi>Son</hi> therefore, the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> in Trinity, conſidered as <hi>God,</hi> ſo <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is made to him as well as to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:99997:124"/>now conſider him as <hi>God-man</hi> and <hi>Mediator,</hi> ſo he is the Perſon that makes the ſatisfaction; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> conſidered as <hi>Mediator,</hi> makes ſatisfaction to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, conſidered as <hi>God.</hi> Hence are thoſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people.</hi> Here we ſee how Chriſt hath redeemed and purified to <hi>himſelf</hi> a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.7. <hi>That he might preſent it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a glorious Church.</hi> Neither is it <hi>incongruous</hi> or <hi>improper</hi> to ſay, that Chriſt hath made ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to himſelf, becauſe amongſt men one man doth not ſatisfie himſelf, but one man makes ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to another; I ſay this is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous or improper in reſpect of Chriſt; and the reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt may be conſidered two ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt may be conſidered in reſpect of his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> as he is one with the Father. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one, Joh.</hi> 10.30. In this reſpect, Chriſt is the Perſon offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Conſider Chriſt in reſpect of his <hi>Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> meerly, ſo he is the Perſon offended.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt may be conſidered as to his <hi>Office,</hi> which he <hi>voluntarily</hi> undertook; and ſo, though he were the Perſon offended, yet was he willing to take our nature, and in that nature to become a <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and us by his own <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary condeſcenſion:</hi> ſo that the <hi>ſame Perſon,</hi> after a different reſpect or conſideration, receives the ſatisfaction, and alſo gave it. Chriſt received the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Atonement,</hi> conſidered as God, he alſo offered the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> as Mediator as God-man in a way of voluntary condeſcenſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another thing that is to be laid down is this:
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:99997:124"/>We ſay that Chriſts Satisfaction is one of his <hi>Mediatorial actions,</hi> becauſe there was the <hi>concourſe</hi> of both the <hi>Natures</hi> in Chriſt in this work of his Satisfaction. Chriſt is <hi>Mediator</hi> according to <hi>both Natures,</hi> and in all the <hi>Mediatorial actions</hi> of Chriſt, the <hi>Perſon</hi> acts in <hi>both Natures, influencing</hi> each nature to do that which is proper to it ſelf. It is a known Rule in <hi>Divinity:
<note place="margin">
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tra<expan>
                              <am>
                                 <g ref="char:abque"/>
                              </am>
                              <ex>que</ex>
                           </expan> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura agit cum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terius.</note> Each of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt acts with a communion of the other Nature.</hi> The work of Satisfaction is neither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed by the <hi>Divinity</hi> without the <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> neither is it performed by the <hi>Humanity</hi> without the influence and virtue of the <hi>Divinity.</hi> The <hi>Divine Nature</hi> in Chriſt is the <hi>principal effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> cauſe, and the <hi>humane Nature</hi> is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the miniſtring or <hi>ſubſervient</hi> cauſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. our Saviour tells us, That <hi>the fleſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits nothing, it is the Spirit that quickens.</hi> Although the <hi>actions</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> performed by him in his Humanity, were the <hi>matter</hi> of his ſatisfaction, yet it was the <hi>Divinity</hi> that gave virtue and efficacy unto all. It is in the <hi>humane Nature</hi> that Chriſt <hi>obeyed, ſuffered, dyed;</hi> but it is by virtue of the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> that his obedience becomes <hi>meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,</hi> and his ſufferings become <hi>ſatisfactory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſay in the deſcription, That the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt is one of his Mediatorial actions, and particularly an act of his <hi>Prieſthood.</hi> To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this, we muſt conſider, that there were two things that did belong to the Office of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> under the Law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To <hi>offer Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>intercede</hi> for the People.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt therefore being made of God a <hi>High-Prieſt according to the order of Melchiſedec,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 6.20.</note> he alſo
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:99997:125"/>muſt have ſome Sacrifice to offer, without a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice he could not be a Prieſt. This the Apoſtle teacheth clearly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.3. <hi>Every High-Prieſt is ordained to offer gifts and ſacrifices, therefore it is of neceſſity that this man have ſomething alſo to offer.</hi> If Chriſt be a Prieſt, he muſt have ſomething to offer, there muſt be ſome Sacrifice that he muſt offer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third thing we have to inquire into is this, What the <hi>matter</hi> of this ſatisfaction is; for we ſay in the deſcription, Chriſt offers <hi>himſelf</hi> a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our ſins. I know it is commonly ſaid, That the <hi>humane Nature</hi> was the Sacrifice that was offered. Now although this expreſſion, if rightly underſtood, may be admitted, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Chriſt ſuffered in the fleſh for us;</hi> ſo we have the expreſſion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. <hi>That for as much as Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh,</hi> that is, in his <hi>Humanity;</hi> it was by means of the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature</hi> that Chriſt was <hi>capable</hi> of ſuffering, and it was in that nature that he did ſuffer; alſo we read, that Chriſt had a body prepared for him, and that <hi>body</hi> was offered up, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified by the offering up the body of Jeſus once for all:</hi> Yet notwithſtanding this is evident, that the <hi>Scripture,</hi> when it ſpeaks of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſt, doth moſt commonly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently call it, the <hi>Sacrifice of himſelf.</hi> There are many Texts to this purpoſe: <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>He gave himſelf for our ſins.</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>He gave himſelf for me.</hi> Eph. 5.2. <hi>Chriſt hath loved us, and given himſelf for us.</hi> Eph. 5.25. <hi>Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>Who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himſelf a peculiar people.</hi> Heb. 1.3.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:99997:125"/>
                     <hi>When he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſate down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi> Heb. 7.27. <hi>This he did once, when he offered up himſelf.</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>By the eternal Spirit he offered himſelf without ſpot to God. And he put away our ſins by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> And it is an emphatical Scripture, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his body on the tree.</hi>

For though it were the <hi>humane Nature</hi> only that was capable of ſuffering; yet the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> was united to the humane nature in the time of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>ſecond Perſon in Trinity,</hi> was conjoyned with the fleſh, and it was his own fleſh that he gave for the life of the world. Hence is that ſpeech of <hi>Athanaſius:

                           </gap>. Athanaſ.</note> That very fleſh was not the fleſh of any other perſon, but it was the fleſh of the Word himſelf.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expreſſion to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>They do erre,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who ſay that there was another Son which did ſuffer, and another which did not ſuffer; for there was not another beſides the Son of God, who underwent death and ſufferings for us.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> in <hi>Trinity,</hi> was conjoyned with the fleſh. Though the <hi>fleſh</hi> only was capable of ſuffering, yet the <hi>Word</hi> was in conjunction with the fleſh; therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>It is my fleſh which I will give for the life of the world, Joh.</hi> 6. It was his <hi>own fleſh,</hi> and not the fleſh of any other. To
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:99997:126"/>illuſtrate and confirm this yet farther we ought to conſider, that in the ſufferings of Chriſt there was the <hi>voluntary humiliation</hi> of that <hi>great Perſon</hi> who was <hi>God</hi> as well as man, <hi>He who was in the form of God emptied himſelf, taking on him the form of a ſervant, and he humbled himſelf and became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the death, even the death of the Croſs, Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7.</p>
                  <p>Here are <hi>two Acts</hi> ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His <hi>emptying</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His <hi>humbling</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>His <hi>emptying</hi> himſelf was diſcovered in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation,</hi> and taking on the <hi>form of a ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His <hi>humbling</hi> himſelf was ſeen in his ſufferings, and in the work of his Satisfaction, in being <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> Not but that his <hi>Incarnation</hi> was alſo a part of his humbling of himſelf; but the Apoſtle ſpeaks of theſe two diſtinctly. He tells us, That he who was in the <hi>form</hi> of God <hi>emptied</hi> himſelf, taking on him the <hi>form</hi> of a ſervant, and he <hi>humbled</hi> himſelf, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>Now both theſe Acts of his, his <hi>humbling</hi> and his <hi>emptying</hi> himſelf, they are the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> they are the acts of that Perſon who was in the <hi>form of God.</hi> It was he, who being in the <hi>form of God,</hi> who <hi>emptied</hi> himſelf by taking upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant:</hi> and it was he that was in the <hi>form of God,</hi> that <hi>humbled himſelf, and became obedient to the death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> So that in the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider more than the bare oblation of the humane nature, we ought to conſider the conjunction of the <hi>Word,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, with the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:99997:126"/>fleſh, and we ought to conſider the voluntary hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of that glorious Perſon, the Son of God, who being in the form of God, did not only ſtoop ſo low as to come into our nature; but being in that nature, humbled himſelf ſo far as to become a Sacrifice for us. I ſay, in the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſt we ought to conſider the will of the Perſon, who being God as well as man, there was the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of the Divine will as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his humane will. The Son of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our nature, voluntarily offers himſelf in that nature as a Sacrifice for our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Particular to be ſpoken to is this, The form of Chriſts Satisfaction, and that conſiſts in this, That Chriſt made a <hi>full compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God for the ſins of his people.</p>
                  <p>There are three things that concur to make up this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of what we ought to ſuffer. Hence it is ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for us,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. And <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, Iſa.</hi> 53. And <hi>By his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. The <hi>ſtripes</hi> that ſhould have been laid upon us, were laid upon Chriſt: ſo that Chriſt ſuffered the ſubſtance of what we ought to ſuffer. The Law pronounced a <hi>Curſe</hi> upon all the tranſgreſſors of it. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> Now Chriſt <hi>was made a curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3.10. If Chriſt did not ſuffer the <hi>whole puniſhment</hi> due to us for our ſins, then that part of the puniſhment, which he did not ſuffer, remains ſtill for us to be ſuffered; for this is certain, <hi>Not one iota or tittle
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:99997:127"/>of the Law ſhall paſs away, till all be fulfilled, Mat.</hi> 5.18. The whole <hi>preceptive part</hi> of the Law muſt be fulfilled, the <hi>minatory</hi> or <hi>threatning</hi> part of the Law muſt be fulfilled. Therefore if there be any part of that puniſhment, which the Law would inflict upon us, not undergone, it remains to be fulfilled by us. But now Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us from the <hi>whole Curſe</hi> of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Therefore Chriſt hath born the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that we ought to undergo: but of this more hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt hath ſuffered what <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> could demand, otherwiſe there was not a <hi>full compenſation</hi> to Divine Juſtice. But now this is the excellency of Chriſts Satisfaction, that in the Satisfaction of Chriſt there is as much given as <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> could demand, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> The ſcope of the Apoſtles argument tends to this, That it is a righteous thing with God to forgive ſins when he hath received ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for them. Now if the compenſation had not been perfect that was given, the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God had not ſo much appeared in the <hi>forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of ſins; but God having received a full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, having received whatever Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice could require at the hand of Chriſt, now he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins. It being therefore a part of Gods Juſtice to give remiſſion of ſins to as many as Chriſts Satisfaction is applied, it is a certain ſign Chriſt hath ſuffered as much as Divine Juſtice could demand or require.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, Chriſt having ſuffered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of what we were to ſuffer, and Chriſt having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered what Divine Juſtice could demand, God
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:99997:127"/>is perfectly pleaſed and ſatisfied in what Chriſt hath ſuffered, and hath nothing more to lay to the charge of his people: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> When the debt is fully paid, the <hi>Creditor</hi> hath full ſatisfaction, he deſires no more. Thus Chriſt having fully diſcharged our debt, God expects no more from us to anſwer his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he is fully ſatisfied in what Chriſt hath done: that is the fourth thing in the deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth and laſt thing is this, What the effects of Chriſts Satisfaction are, and they are three.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>averting</hi> and turning away of Gods wrath.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>purchaſe</hi> of pardon of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>procuring</hi> of eternal life for us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One effect of Chriſts Satisfaction was the averting and turning away of Gods wrath, God is highly offended and diſpleaſed with us as we are <hi>ſinners.</hi> Sin expoſeth us to Divine wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hence is it ſaid, That <hi>by nature we are children of wrath, Eph.</hi> 2.3. And the ſentence of the Law is <hi>Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>Wrath</hi> is due to us as we are <hi>ſinners;</hi> now Chriſt by the work of his Satisfaction turns away this wrath from us. He it is that trod <hi>the wine-preſs of divine wrath, Iſa.</hi> 63.3. And Chriſt bearing the wrath of God for us, delivers us from that wrath. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>We are ſaved from wrath through him, Rom.</hi> 5.9. And that <hi>We are delivered from wrath to come by him,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1. ult. <hi>Jeſus that delivereth us from the wrath to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:99997:128"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond effect of Chriſts Satisfaction is the procuring of <hi>pardon of ſin</hi> for us. Thus in thoſe known words of the Inſtitution of the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> our Saviour tells us, <hi>This is the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in my blood that was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The blood of Chriſt was ſhed on purpoſe to procure the pardon of ſin, and it doth procure pardon of ſin for us: <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi> One great fruit of Chriſts Satisfaction, and our Redemption by Chriſt is, that by means of that Satisfaction and Redemption of his, we ſhould have forgiveneſs of ſins; therefore in the Text mentioned before it is ſaid, <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins, Rom.</hi> 3.25. The meaning I take to be this, That God having received ſatisfaction through the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, thereupon he gives forth pardon and remiſſion of ſins to us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third effect of Chriſts Satisfaction is eternal life. Chriſt by his Satisfaction procures eternal life for us: hence is it, that we read of the promiſe of an <hi>eternal inheritance through the death of Chriſt, Heb.</hi> 9.15. Chriſts ſufferings are not only <hi>ſatisfactory,</hi> but they are alſo <hi>meritorious.</hi> Chriſts ſufferings did not only turn away the evil of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from us, but they procured the good of eternal life for us. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>That grace reigns through righteouſneſs unto eternal life by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> The obedience of Chriſt <hi>active</hi> and <hi>paſſive</hi> is operative to bring us to eternal life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> See what infinite reaſon there is, that we ſhould ſeek after a part and intereſt in Chriſts Satisfaction. For,</p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:99997:128"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Without an intereſt in Chriſts Satisfaction we are liable to anſwer to Divine Juſtice in our own perſons. Divine Juſtice will be ſatisfied one way or other, for God himſelf hath pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, That he <hi>will by no means clear the guilty, Exod.</hi> 34.7. <hi>God is juſt, and the juſtifier of them that believe in Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 3.26. Therefore if we do not get an intereſt in Chriſt, that he may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for us, we are liable to be caſt into priſon by the hand of Divine Juſtice, and we ſhall not come forth thence till we have paid the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Without an intereſt in Chriſts Satisfaction Divine wrath ſtill hangs over us. It is Chriſt only that by his Satisfaction pacifies and turns away Gods wrath; therefore unleſs we have a part in Chriſts Satisfaction, <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>unſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> wrath hangs over our heads every moment, and will aſſuredly fall upon us, and we know not how ſoon it may do ſo. <hi>He that believes not on the Son hath not life, but the wrath of God abides upon him, Joh.</hi> 3. <hi>ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Without an intereſt in Chriſts Satisfaction we cannot have the pardon of ſin; for it is by the Satisfaction of Chriſt, as we have heard, that pardon of ſin is procured. We are liable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Gods Juſtice for all our ſins, and all our ſins will certainly come in againſt us to condemn us, unleſs we have a part in Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Without an intereſt in Chriſts Satisfaction we can make out no <hi>title</hi> to eternal life. Heaven is called <hi>the purchaſed inheritance, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion, Eph.</hi> 1.14. Heaven is the purchaſe of the death and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of Chriſt; therefore unleſs we have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:99997:129"/>in the virtue of Chriſts ſufferings, we can have no title to the heavenly inheritance. Here it may be ſaid, But what ſhall we do that we may have a part in Chriſts Satisfaction?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us labour to ſee our <hi>infinite</hi> need of Chriſt and his Satisfaction: we never ſee the worth of Chriſts Satisfaction till firſt we ſee our ſelves to be condemned perſons. O let us be more deeply ſenſible what the Law and Divine Juſtice have againſt us. As we are ſinners, we are condemned perſons in Law. <hi>The wages of ſin is death. The ſoul that ſins ſhall dye.</hi> This is the ſentence of the Law. O let us labour to be deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of this, and then we ſhall ſee the need of Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we would have an intereſt in Chriſts Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, let us labour to <hi>know Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he determined to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. You will ſay, Why is the knowledge of a cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſt ſo neceſſary to Salvation? The reaſon is, becauſe the death and ſufferings of Chriſt is the only means of atonement, and to bring us unto reconciliation with God: <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation.</hi> There is no <hi>pacifying</hi> of an angry God but by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and it is Faith in his Blood that gives us an intereſt in the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Him hath God ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> We muſt therefore cloſe with a crucified Chriſt by faith, caſt an <hi>aſpect of faith</hi> upon the Son of God in our nature offering himſelf up to God as a Sacrifice for our ſins. It is faith in this Sacrifice of Chriſt that muſt procure
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:99997:129"/>reconciliation for us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is lifted up as the brazen Serpent was lifted up. It was their <hi>looking</hi> on the <hi>brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> that brought healing to them that were ſtung by the fiery Serpents; and it is our <hi>looking upon</hi> a crucified Chriſt by an eye of faith, caſting an <hi>aſpect</hi> of faith upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>crucified,</hi> and the virtue of his ſufferings that muſt bring Salvation to us, who are ſinners, and who deſerve to periſh as we are ſuch.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Now proceed to the ſecond thing, which is to lay down ſeveral diſtinct and particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for the clearing of this great Doctrine, the Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>And here the Propoſitions that I ſhall lay down will for the moſt part depend one upon another, and the former Propoſition will be introductory and leading to them that do ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>Before I come to lay down thoſe Propoſitions that do immediately concern the Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction it ſelf, there are ſome Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to be laid down that are preliminary; and neceſſary to make way thereupon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt Propoſition then is this: Man was created under a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to his Maker. Man, when firſt he came out of the hands of God, muſt needs ſee himſelf in a ſtate of <hi>inferiority</hi> unto God; he ſaw that God was <hi>above</hi> him, and that he had received his being from God, and that receiving his Being from God, he muſt neceſſarily be in a ſtate of inferio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and ſubjection to him. Man alſo ſaw, that having received his Being from God, he was under a <hi>vaſt obligation</hi> of <hi>gratitude, love</hi> and <hi>ſervice</hi> into God, who had given him <hi>Being,</hi> and ſuch
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:99997:130"/>an <hi>excellent Being:</hi> man alſo ſaw, that receiving his Being from another, and not having it from himſelf, it was moſt juſt and reaſonable that he ſhould be under the will of him who gave him his Being, and not under the conduct and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own will.</p>
                  <p>Theſe deductions do naturally flow from the principles of right reaſon, which we muſt ſuppoſe to be in man in his primitive eſtate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Propoſition is this: That man was every way fitted and qualified to give obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law of his Creation. Man, we know, at firſt was created after the image of God in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs; and man being cloathed with the image of God, was every way fitted to give to God that obedience which the Law of his Creation required from him. Mans <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>underſtanding</hi> was filled with <hi>light</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> whereby he clearly underſtood what the will of God, and what his own duty was. Mans will alſo, as it was firſt created, had no <hi>obliquity</hi> in it, but was inclined to good, his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions were all regular. <hi>God made man upright,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. Every thing was <hi>upright,</hi> moſt upright in man in his firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was nothing out of order in him, the will of man was then upright. It is true, although the will of man was made upright and good at firſt, yet it was not made <hi>immutably</hi> good; but that it was poſſible for man to decline from good to evil, otherwiſe it had not been poſſible for man to have fallen and ſinned; but ſin and fall he did, and that we know by our own ſad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. But yet, though man was not created at firſt in an impeccable eſtate, but that it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:99997:131"/>for him to ſin; yet he was created in ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a ſtate, that it was poſſible for him not to have ſinned.

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third Propoſition is this: God, to lay a further ingagement upon man to perſevere in the courſe of his obedience, entred into a Covenant or ſtipulation with man, promiſing him life in caſe of obedience, and threatning him with death in caſe of diſobedience. This we have expreſſed in that known Text, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>And the Lord God commanded the man, ſaying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayſt freely eat. But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> Here we have a <hi>poſitive Law</hi> ſupperadded unto the natural Law, the Law of mans creation, and there is a threatning annexed to deter man from breaking this Law, in which threatning alſo there is a promiſe ſuppoſed to be included in caſe man did not break it; for if God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, in caſe he did eat, that he ſhall dye, this is to be ſuppoſed, if he did not eat nor tranſgreſs this command, he ſhould not dye, elſe the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning had been in vain. Now we muſt know, that man by virtue of the natural Law, the Law of his creation, was bound to obſerve this poſitive Law of God: And the reaſon is, becauſe man being a creature, muſt neceſſarily be under the will and at the diſpoſe of him that makes him, and therefore muſt neceſſarily be obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:99997:131"/>his Creators will in all things that he ſhall declare to be his will; therefore it pleaſing God to give out this poſitive Law concerning the not eating of the <hi>Tree of knowledge of good and evil,</hi> as a tryal of mans obedience, man by virtue of the natural Law, the Law of his creation, is bound to give obedience to God in this poſitive Law of his. For man, as he is a creature, is bound to give obedience to the Law and Will of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in that way God requires and expects it of him; and God having manifeſted this to be his Will, the Law of his creation obligeth him to teſtifie his reſpect and obedience to God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he hath diſcovered his mind to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth Propoſition is this: That man ſinning, God is highly offended with him by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin. Sin is moſt diſpleaſing to God upon ſeveral accounts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſin is moſt contrary to the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sin is contrary to the <hi>Nature</hi> of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath pleaſure in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with thee.</hi> Hab. 1.13. <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity.</hi> 1 Joh. 1.5. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all.</hi> God is <hi>perfection,</hi> and ſin is <hi>imperfection,</hi> God is <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> it ſelf, and ſin is a defect of that purity; therefore the nature of God is moſt <hi>diametrically</hi> oppoſite to ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin is contrary to the <hi>Will</hi> of God. The Will of God is expreſſed and declared in his Law. Now the Law of God commands <hi>rectitude,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>rectitude: The commandment is holy, juſt and good,</hi> Rom. 7.12. <hi>Thy righteouſneſs is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:99997:132"/>righteouſneſs, and thy law is truth, Pſal.</hi> 119.142. Now ſin is a <hi>deviation</hi> from that <hi>rectitude</hi> which the Law requires, ſin is a perfect <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> to the will of God revealed in his Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sin is moſt diſpleaſing unto God, becauſe it is a caſting off of Gods <hi>Authority.</hi> This we muſt neceſſarily ſuppoſe, that God being infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſuperiour</hi> unto man, and the <hi>Author</hi> of mans Being, muſt needs have the moſt perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute authority over man. Now man when he ſins, when he takes upon him to ſin, acts accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own will, and takes no notice of the Divine Law, and ſo conſequently caſts off Gods Authority. Man when he ſins, acts after that manner as if ſo be there were none above him, whoſe will he were bound to take notice of. Hence is that expreſſion in the Book of <hi>Job, Job</hi> 21.15. <hi>Who is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him?</hi> This is the language of wicked men, this is virtually the language of every ſin. Every ſin is a diſavowing of Gods Authority, it is <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>interpretatively</hi> a renouncing Gods Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Man by ſin, as he doth <hi>virtually</hi> and <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatively</hi> caſt off Gods Authority: ſo he doth <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> caſt off his own ſubjection unto God. God gives to man a Law as the <hi>Rule</hi> of his obedience, and he doth plainly refuſe to be ſubject to that Law. This is that which the Lord complains of in many places, <hi>Jer.</hi> 11.7, 8. <hi>For I earneſtly proteſted to your fathers, in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, riſing early, and proteſting, ſaying, Obey my voice.</hi> Here is Gods command; but what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? <hi>Yet they obeyed not, but walked every one in
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:99997:132"/>the imagination of their evil heart.</hi> Sin is a perfect caſting off of the creatures ſubjection unto God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another account upon which ſin is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto God is this: Man by ſin <hi>prefers</hi> his own will before his Creators will. God hath declared this or that to be his will in ſuch or ſuch a Law of his, but mans will lies croſs and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereunto; and when man ſins, he makes Gods will to ſtoop to his will: now what is this but a <hi>manifeſt contempt</hi> of God, when man, who is but a creature, prefers his own private will above the ſupreme and ſoveraign Will of his Maker?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Sin is moſt diſpleaſing unto God upon this account, becauſe man by ſin makes himſelf his <hi>laſt end,</hi> and refers all to himſelf. Man, when he ſins, ſeeks not to pleaſe God, but ſeeks to pleaſe himſelf only, and what is this but to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf his laſt end? Now as the <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies in love to God, ſo the very quinteſſence of ſin lies in <hi>ſelf-love.</hi> Now when man is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up in ſelf-love and ſelf-pleaſing, he is perfectly carried off from God as his laſt end, and wholly centers in himſelf; and when man makes himſelf his laſt end, what doth he do but as it were make himſelf a God to himſelf: For what is more proper to God than this, to be his own end, to make himſelf his laſt end? that which is proper to God is to be the firſt cauſe and the laſt end. Now man by ſin makes himſelf his laſt end, and ſo by conſequence makes himſelf a God to himſelf. If this be the nature of ſin, that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth man to dethrone God, and to ſet up himſelf for God inſtead of God, this muſt needs render ſin moſt diſpleaſing unto God, and he muſt needs be highly offended with man by reaſon of it.</p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:99997:133"/>
                  <p n="5">5. The fifth Propoſition is: Man having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Nature of God as he is <hi>juſt,</hi> as well as the Will of God as he is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> to his word, inclines him to puniſh ſin. I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into that diſpute, whether or no God out of his abſolute Power might not have pardoned ſin without ſatisfaction. This is a Queſtion much agitated; but I ſhall wave that Controverſie, and ſhall content my ſelf to lay down ſuch Principles as are more plain, and may be more eaſily taken in by all.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then I ſay, That the Nature of God as he is <hi>juſt,</hi> inclines him to puniſh ſin. God is often called in Scripture a <hi>Juſt</hi> and a <hi>Righteous</hi> God, and as he is a <hi>righteous</hi> God, ſo he loves <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Pſal. 11.7. <hi>The righteous God loveth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And in that place the Righteouſneſs of God is given as the reaſon why it is that God puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wicked men; for in the verſes immediately foregoing it is ſaid, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the wicked he ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt, this ſhall be the portion of their cup.</hi> And then the reaſon is added in thoſe words, <hi>For the righteous God loveth righteouſneſs.</hi> As much as if it had been ſaid, The <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Gods <hi>Nature</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him to deal <hi>righteouſly</hi> with men.
<note place="margin">Juſtitia eſt ſuum cui<expan>

                     <hi>It is the part of juſtice to diſtribute to every man his own.</hi> Therefore ſince puniſhment belongs to wicked men, it is the Righteouſneſs of God to meaſure out to them what they do deſerve. To underſtand this we muſt conſider, that man ſtanding in the relation of a creature unto God, and upon that account being under a Law of obedience to his Maker, God having alſo laid ſo great an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon man by giving him ſo excellent a Being,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:99997:133"/>in caſe man ſin againſt the duty which he is under as a creature; and if he ſin againſt that obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is laid upon him by his Creator in giving him a Being, and ſo excellent a Being, man in ſo doing ſins againſt all <hi>right</hi> and <hi>equity;</hi> and God, as he is the <hi>Rector</hi> and <hi>Governor</hi> of the World, cannot but take notice of ſuch obliquity in man, and teſtifie his diſpleaſure againſt man for violating the Law of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Equity.</hi> Hence is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> The plain meaning I take to be, That God is highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with men by reaſon of ſin, and he teſtifies his diſpleaſure againſt ſin by executing his Judgments in an open manner many times, even as by a hand from Heaven. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven,</hi> &amp;c. there is a finger ſtretched out from Heaven in the Judgments of God, whereby God doth teſtifie and declare to all the world his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt ſin. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. This is the judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi> This is the <hi>Judgment of God:</hi>

                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> this Judgment of God I take to be the <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>upright determination</hi> of God, the <hi>dictate</hi> of the <hi>Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> to ſpeak after the manner of men, determining what is juſt, what is fit and equal; this is that which the Divine Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing determines, that man ſinning, he is worthy of death. <hi>This is the judgment of God,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>that they that commit ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi> It is that which the Divine Wiſdom and Underſtanding determines as juſt, fit, and equal, that mans ſinning ſhould be puniſhed with death, there is a <hi>condignity</hi> in the nature of ſin that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:99997:134"/>puniſhment: ſo that either God muſt go contrary to what his infinite and moſt unerring Wiſdom determines to be <hi>right, fit,</hi> and <hi>equal,</hi> or elſe he muſt puniſh ſin; for this is the Judgment of God, ſaith the Apoſtle, that the <hi>ſinner</hi> is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death; therefore that muſt not be done which the Divine Wiſdom thinks juſt, fit, and equal ſhould be done, or elſe the perſon that ſins muſt fall under puniſhment. Now the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.2. That the <hi>Judgment of God is according to truth,</hi> and this is when he is ſpeaking of this very judgment of his in inflicting death upon the ſinner. <hi>The judgment of God is according to truth,</hi> that is, God in determining to puniſh men for ſin, determines according to right and equity: God is not too rigorous and ſevere in ſo doing; but he doth determine according to the equity and righteouſneſs of the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Now that the Nature of God, as he is a juſt and a holy God, inclines him to puniſh ſin, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from three conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God <hi>hates</hi> ſin infinitely, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.4. <hi>O do not that abominable thing which I hate.</hi> Sin is that abominable thing which God hates, and Gods hatred of ſin ariſeth from the <hi>Holineſs</hi> of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: God is ſo holy, that he cannot but hate ſin. It is not a matter of liberty to God for him to hate ſin, or not to hate it; God hates ſin neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, he cannot but hate it; as he is neceſſarily holy, ſo he doth neceſſarily hate ſin. Now if God do hate ſin, if he hate it infinitely, if he hate it neceſſarily, then he cannot (to ſpeak after the manner of men) but have an infinite averſation from it; for what we hate, we have a perfect averſation from: and if God hath an infinite
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:99997:134"/>averſation from ſin, as we may ſuppoſe that he hath, becauſe he hates it, how ſhould he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt and declare this averſation but by puniſhing of it? This is ſufficiently declared in the Text I mentioned before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men.</hi> As much as if it had been ſaid, God hates ſin infinitely, and hath all along manifeſted this his hatred and indignation againſt ſin by the judgments which he hath executed in all Ages of the World. The drowning of the <hi>old World:</hi> the burning of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> by fire and brimſtone from Heaven: the ſwallowing up of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and all thoſe remarkable Judgments which we read of in the Word of God, what are theſe but ſo many infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proofs of Gods hatred of ſin, and his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it? His nature is ſet againſt it, and he declares the Holineſs and Righteouſneſs of his Nature by the Judgments he inflicts upon men for the commiſſion of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Nature of God, as he is a holy and juſt God, inclines him to puniſh ſin: this alſo will evince it, That it is a Principle that is inlaid in the minds of men, that there is <hi>corrective</hi> or <hi>puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Juſtice in God, whereby he is inclined to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh men when they ſin. Hence was it, that the Heathens ſpake of an <hi>avenging Eye,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> ſuch an Eye as ſaw and beheld all mens evil actions, and was ready to avenge them. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the Gentiles in common, who <hi>knowing</hi> the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, in the Text I mentioned before, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> As there is ſuch a thing as <hi>corrective</hi> or <hi>punitive</hi> Juſtice in God, ſo all men, by the light of Nature, retain ſome ſenſe of it in themſelves. It
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:99997:135"/>is one of thoſe common notions that is impreſſed in the minds of men, and I think we may ſay it is indelible, that God is <hi>juſt, moſt juſt,</hi> and as he is juſt, ſo he is inclined to render to all men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works.
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> This the Apoſtle calls <hi>the righteous judgment of God,</hi> and this righteous judgment of God conſiſts in this, that he will render to all men according to their works. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of this at large, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5, &amp;c. <hi>But after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart treaſureſt up to thy ſelf wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi> The Apoſtle calls it <hi>the righteous judgment of God:</hi> and wherein doth this righteous judgment of God conſiſt? he tells us in the next verſe, <hi>Who will render to every man according to his deeds. To them who by patient continuance in well doing, ſeek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life. But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil; but glory, honour and peace to every one that worketh good.</hi> This is the <hi>righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of God. And if we compare this with the foregoing verſes, it will appear, that men have ſome <hi>ſenſe</hi> of this righteous judgment of God in themſelves; for in the firſt verſe of the ſecond Chapter it is ſaid, <hi>Thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoſoever thou art that judgeſt.</hi> What is it that men judge? They judge that which is ſpoken of in the laſt verſe of the firſt Chapter, <hi>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death.</hi> Men have this judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>themſelves,</hi> that when they <hi>ſin</hi> they are <hi>worthy of death:</hi> this is the <hi>judgment</hi> which they have in their own conſciences.</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:99997:135"/>
                  <p n="3">3. As this impreſſion is left in the hearts of men that God is <hi>juſt,</hi> ſo men are under ſome <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>expectation</hi> of <hi>puniſhment</hi> after they have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, upon this account, becauſe God is <hi>juſt.</hi> Hence is it, that God tells <hi>Cain, In caſe thou do evil ſin lieth at the door, Gen.</hi> 4.7. Sin lieth at the door, that is, the <hi>guilt</hi> of ſin. No ſooner doth a man commit ſin, but conſcience, if it be awakened, will tell him preſently that puniſhment is due for that ſin. Now theſe three conſiderations ſhew that God is holy and juſt, and as he is holy and juſt, ſo his nature inclines him to puniſh ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing is this: The <hi>Will</hi> of God, as he is true and faithful to his word, inclines him to puniſh ſin. God threatned, that <hi>in the day that man ſinned, he ſhould dye the death.</hi> Now God muſt be true to his own word. This is certain, God decreed to puniſh ſin, and he could decree nothing but what was <hi>juſt.</hi> God having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>juſtly</hi> decreed to puniſh ſin, and manifeſted that Decree in his word of threatning, God muſt be true to his own Decree and his Word in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing man when he ſinned. Pertinent to this is that paſſage, which I have met with in a Learned man: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>cannot act or do any thing contrary to his own will, now God wills that which is juſt, and this was juſt, that the puniſhment and all the puniſhment that was due by the Law ſhould be ſuffered and undergone.</hi> Hence he infers, that this Propoſition is always true, That God could not have delivered mankind from <hi>miſery,</hi> but by a <hi>full ſatisfaction,</hi> and that all that which the Law requires to be undergone ſhould be undergone;
<note place="margin">Dei poſſe, velle eſt, non poſſe nolle.</note> God <hi>could not,</hi> becauſe he <hi>would not:</hi> he could not, becauſe he had determined, that the puniſhment
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:99997:136"/>which the Law did denounce, ſhould be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone and inflicted. It is a good ſpeech of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">Quod ad po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam Dei omnia ei poſſibilia funt, quod adjuſtitiam poſſibilia ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la quae ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta.</note> 
                     <hi>As to the power of God, all things are poſſible unto God; but as to the juſtice of God, nothing is poſſible but what is juſt.</hi> Therefore God having decreed, and that moſt juſtly, to puniſh ſin, God could not but puniſh ſin.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth Propoſition is: That God being <hi>merciful</hi> as well as <hi>juſt,</hi> doth in his <hi>infinite Wiſdom</hi> find out a way, how his <hi>Juſtice</hi> may be <hi>ſalved,</hi> and man not periſh. This is that which the Apoſtle declares to us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25, 26. <hi>All have ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God, being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, To declare his righteouſneſs, for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God, to declare, I ſay, at this time his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that he might be juſt and the juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> The ſcope of the Apoſtle is plainly this, To ſhew that God hath a mind to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give ſin, and yet he would be juſt too; therefore that he might be <hi>merciful</hi> and <hi>juſt</hi> both at once, God found out a way how he might forgive ſin, and yet his Juſtice not be prejudiced. Hence was it, that God appointed Chriſt to be a <hi>ranſom</hi> for us, that ſo Chriſt bearing the puniſhment that we deſerved, the Juſtice of God might be ſatisfied in what Chriſt ſuffered, and yet his Mercy might be glorified in remitting the <hi>puniſhment</hi> to us: <hi>Him hath God ordained to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. God remits ſin freely as to us, and ſo his mercy is glorified as to us; and yet he receives full ſatisfaction from Chriſt, and ſo his Juſtice is glorified in him. Thus
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:99997:136"/>
                     <hi>mercy and truth are met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other, Pſal.</hi> 85.10. God having found full ſatisfaction to his Juſtice in the blood of Chriſt, there is a ſweet reconciliation between thoſe two ſeeming contrary Attributes, the Juſtice and Mercy of God. This is elegantly ſet forth by one of the <hi>Ancients</hi> after this manner: <hi>There is a controverſie or a ſtrife as it were between the Juſtice and the Mercy of God;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Altercatio eſt inter Dei juſtitiam &amp; miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiam.</note> but this ſtrife is ended in the death of Chriſt, becauſe in the death of our Saviour Divine Juſtice is ſatisfied in all that it did deſire. <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> ſaith, If <hi>Adam</hi> dye not I am loſt; and Mercy on the other hand ſaith, If <hi>Adam</hi> doth not obtain mercy one way or other I am loſt: now Chriſt interpoſing by his death, each of theſe Attributes have what they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                  <p>Learn from what hath been ſaid the Juſtice, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>I Proceed now to the ſeventh Propoſition, which is this: It was the <hi>compact</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> that the <hi>Son,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in <hi>Trinity,</hi> ſhould take our nature, and in that nature become our Surety, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the payment and diſcharge of our <hi>debt</hi> for us. I ſay this was the <hi>compact</hi> and <hi>agreement</hi> between the Father and the Son: hence is it ſaid, <hi>The counſel of peace was between them both, Zach.</hi> 6.13. Some Learned men render it, <hi>Between thoſe two,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Inter illos duos.</note> that is, between the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of peace</hi> was between them both.</p>
                  <p>Here it may be ſaid, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> How could there be ſuch a compact or an agreement as this is between the Father and the Son concerning mans Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Salvation? God is but <hi>one,</hi> the Divine Eſſence is but one, and the Divine Will but one: How then could there be this compact and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between the Father and the Son, ſince they are both one and the ſame God, and have one and the ſame eſſential Will?</p>
                  <p>To this the Anſwer is plain, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> that as the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the Father and the Son is but one, ſo the <hi>Will</hi> is but one. But for as much as the Father and the Son are conſidered as <hi>diſtinct Perſons,</hi> ſo the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:99997:139"/>
                     <hi>counſel of peace</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>between them both.</hi> Here are <hi>two Perſons</hi> ſpoken of, from which alſo the third the Holy Ghoſt is not to be excluded, but all the three Perſons agree in one and the ſame will. Now according to the counſel of the <hi>whole Trinity,</hi> the Son, the ſecond Perſon of the three, is to take our nature, and in that nature to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our <hi>Surety;</hi> hence is it ſaid, That <hi>Jeſus is made a ſurety of a better Teſtament, Heb.</hi> 7.22. And Chriſt being made a Surety by virtue of the compact that was between him and the Father, he is to undertake the payment of our debt, for that is the nature of a Surety. A Surety is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly an <hi>

                        </gap>.</note> one that undertakes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers cauſe and debt. There are ſome <hi>Divines</hi> that call this <hi>compact</hi> between the Father and the Son, the <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> and this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Redemption they deſcribe after this fort, namely, <hi>The Covenant of Redemption,</hi> ſay they, it is the agreement between the Father and the Son, who was deſigned to be Mediator concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Elect, who are ſuppoſed to lye in ſin and miſery by their own demerit, together with the reſt of men. I ſay concerning the Elect, to be converted, ſanctified, and ſaved by virtue of the obedience of the Son as Mediator, which was to be performed to the Father, this they call the <hi>Covenant of Redemption.</hi> The Apoſtle doth plainly intimate this compact or agreement that was between the Father and the Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>Wherefore when he cometh into the world he ſaith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me. In burnt-offering and ſacrifice for ſin thou haſt had no pleaſure. Then ſaid, I Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me)
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:99997:139"/>to do thy will, O God.</hi> When Chriſt ſaith here, <hi>Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God,</hi> he plainly refers to that ancient Decree and Compact that was between the Father and himſelf. It was the Fathers will from Eternity, that the Son ſhould take a body and offer up that body to make ſatisfaction for the ſins of the Elect, and the Son conſented to this will of the Father, and what he did in time in aſſuming a body, and in offering up that body, was in purſuance of that ancient Decree and Compact that was between him and the Father; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>In the volume of the book it is written, I come to do thy will, O God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The eighth Propoſition is this: That Chriſt becoming our Surety ſtands <hi>reſponſible</hi> to the Law, and is liable to pay all the debt we owe to God. Hence are thoſe expreſſions, that <hi>he was made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, Gal.</hi> 4.4. That <hi>he was made a Curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3.10. To underſtand this, we muſt know that Chriſt is to be conſidered as a <hi>common Perſon</hi> as ſuſtaining the perſons of all the Elect. Look as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a common perſon, the obedience which he was bound to perform, we were obliged unto; and therefore when he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we ſinned in him, and when he became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the curſe and to death by reaſon of ſin, we alſo became obnoxious to the ſame Curſe and death in him: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>Wherefore as by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned.</hi> So Chriſt is to be conſidered as a <hi>common Perſon,</hi> Chriſt undertaking to be our <hi>Surety,</hi> the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which we were bound to perform, Chriſt is bound to perform, and the puniſhment which we
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:99997:140"/>are obnoxious unto, by reaſon of our violation of the Law, Chriſt becoming our Surety, is obno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious to the ſame puniſhment. Hence is it ſaid of the firſt <hi>Adam,

The figure of him that was to come, that is, the Type of Chriſt: the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> is the Type of the <hi>ſecond Adam.</hi> How ſo? As the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was a <hi>common perſon,</hi> and all his <hi>ſeed</hi> were <hi>comprehended</hi> in him, and <hi>repreſented</hi> by him: ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is to be looked upon as a <hi>common perſon,</hi> and all his <hi>ſeed</hi> are comprehended in him, and repreſented by him; therefore Chriſt is called the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. <hi>The firſt Adam was made a living ſoul, the ſecond Adam was made a quickning Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it may be inquired, How was it that the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a common perſon? And how was it that Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> became a common perſon?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer briefly: The firſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a <hi>common perſon</hi> by <hi>Divine ordination</hi> and <hi>appointment,</hi> and by the <hi>Law</hi> of his Creation, he being the <hi>head</hi> and <hi>root</hi> of all mankind: and Chriſt was made a <hi>common perſon</hi> partly by <hi>Divine ordination</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> and partly by his <hi>own conſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was made a <hi>common perſon</hi> by the <hi>Divine appointment</hi> and <hi>ordination,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Who ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſted in theſe laſt times.</hi>

                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> Chriſt was <hi>foreordained</hi> before the foundation of the world to be the <hi>Head</hi> of the Elect.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt was made a <hi>common perſon</hi> by his own <hi>voluntary undertaking. I lay down my life for my ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10.17. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. he ſaith, <hi>No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of my ſelf, I have
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:99997:140"/>power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.</hi> So that by the Fathers appointment and by his own free and voluntary conſent, Chriſt became a common perſon.</p>
                  <p>The ninth Propoſition is: Chriſt by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>appointment</hi> and by his own <hi>voluntary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking</hi> becoming a <hi>debtor</hi> to the Law, ſtands <hi>obliged</hi> not only to perform the <hi>obedience</hi> which the Law requires, but alſo to undergo and ſuffer the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> the Law exacts for the breach and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of it.</p>
                  <p>How it is that Chriſt ſtands obliged to give that obedience which the Law requires, I have had occaſion to open this heretofore, when I ſpake of that <hi>ſubject,</hi> how he was made under the Law; the other part of the aſſertion is, That Chriſt having taken upon him to be our Surety, makes himſelf liable to bear the puniſhment of the Law, that is that which I am now to ſpeak to, and to ſhew how Chriſt bears the <hi>puniſhment</hi> which we owe to the Law: hence it is ſaid, <hi>That the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, Iſa.</hi> 53. that is, the <hi>puniſhment</hi> which we deſerved is laid upon Chriſt. This muſt be opened in two Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, to ſhew you how it is that the puniſhment that is due to us, is laid upon Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt becoming our <hi>Surety,</hi> the <hi>guilt</hi> of our ſins is laid upon Chriſt. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith a Learned man, <hi>took our ſins upon him, as if ſo be they had been his own, and preſented himſelf before the Tribunal of God, as being laden and burdened with the ſins of all the Elect.</hi> The Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms this in that known Text, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us.</hi> How is Chriſt made ſin for us? Not as if ſo be there were any
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:99997:141"/>ſin in Chriſt in a way of <hi>inheſion;</hi> for he was a <hi>Lamb without ſpot</hi> and <hi>without blemiſh:</hi> and the Text it ſelf doth ſufficiently explain it ſelf as to this; for it tells us, <hi>He was made ſin that knew no ſin.</hi> Therefore when it is ſaid, that Chriſt was <hi>made</hi> ſin, it is plain it was not that he had any ſin inhering in him, as if there were any ſin that did cleave to him. How then was he made ſin? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it was in a way of <hi>imputation,</hi> for as much as the guilt of all our ſins was <hi>imputed</hi> to him: Chriſt had no ſin of his own, but the <hi>guilt</hi> of our ſins was <hi>transferred</hi> upon Chriſt: hence is it ſaid, That <hi>he bare our iniquities, Iſa.</hi> 53. and in this ſenſe that expreſſion of <hi>Luther</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<note place="margin">Maximus peccatorum.</note> 
                     <hi>That Chriſt was the greateſt of Sinners:</hi> for as much as he that had no ſin of his own, took upon him the guilt of all the ſins of the Elect; and indeed we may well ſay with a Learned man: <hi>If Chriſt did not take upon him the guilt of our ſins, then we our ſelves muſt of neceſſity be guilty before God to this very day.</hi> Chriſt therefore took upon him the guilt of our ſins in a way of <hi>imputation,</hi> as our ſins were imputed to him and ſtood charged upon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Particular is: The <hi>puniſhment</hi> it ſelf which guilt obligeth unto, was laid upon Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Reatus eſt obligatio ad poenam.</note> 
                     <hi>Guilt</hi> is an obligation unto <hi>puniſhment:</hi> Chriſt, as he took upon him the guilt of our ſins, ſo he bare the puniſhment that guilt made him liable unto. <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, by his ſtripes we are healed, Iſa.</hi> 53. It is a ſpeech of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">In illo facta eſt punitio quae nobis debebatur.</note> 
                     <hi>That puniſhment was inflicted upon Chriſt that was due to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The tenth Propoſition is: That Chriſt taking upon him the guilt and puniſhment of our ſins,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:99997:141"/>he ſuffered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of what we ought to have ſuffered. This is a Propoſition of great weight and moment, and will bring us nearer the very heart and ſpirit of the Doctrine of Chriſts Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Chriſt did not undergo this or that puniſhment only, but he underwent the ſubſtance of all the puniſhment that we were to ſuffer; and as I ſhall ſhew you hereafter, he ſuffered the <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of the <hi>torments</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> for us. It is true, there are ſome <hi>circumſtances</hi> and adjuncts in the puniſhment of the Damned which Chriſt did not undergo, as namely, <hi>Eternity</hi> of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> the <hi>worm</hi> of <hi>conſcience, deſpair,</hi> theſe Chriſt did not ſuffer, he could not ſuffer theſe, and yet Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the puniſhment that we ſhould have ſuffered, yea he ſuffered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the <hi>torments</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> for us. <hi>Divines</hi> obſerve, that Chriſt in ſome reſpect ſuffered <hi>idem, the ſame</hi> that we ſhould have ſuffered, and in other reſpects he may be ſaid to ſuffer <hi>tantundem,</hi> that which was <hi>equivalent.</hi> It was not neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould undergo all the <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>adjuncts</hi> of puniſhment that the Damned undergo; but yet he ſuffered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of what we ought to have ſuffered. To ſpeak a little to thoſe three <hi>adjuncts,</hi> that I named, of the puniſhment of the Damned which Chriſt did not ſuffer, I will ſhew firſt how Chriſt was exempted from thoſe adjuncts of the puniſhment, and yet how he ſuffered the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the <hi>Eternity</hi> of puniſhment: It was not neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>dignity</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Perſon</hi> was ſuch, that it was <hi>poſſible</hi> for him to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God, and he did ſatisfie the Juſtice of God <hi>fully,</hi> without
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:99997:142"/>ſuffering <hi>eternally.</hi> The reaſon why eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is inflicted on the Damned is, becauſe they cannot ſuffer enough at once to ſatisfie <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice;</hi> therefore what is wanting in a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuffering,</hi> muſt be made up by <hi>duration</hi> and <hi>continuance:</hi> but now it was not thus with Chriſt, Chriſt was able to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God at once; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>That by one offering he hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified, Heb.</hi> 10.14. What was wanting in the <hi>length</hi> and <hi>duration</hi> of Chriſts ſuffering, was made up two ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Partly in the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of his <hi>ſorrows</hi> and <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings.</hi> Chriſt ſuffered more grief and ſorrow, as <hi>Divines</hi> obſerve, than if all the ſorrows and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of all men had been put together.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Partly by the <hi>dignity</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> he being the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and <hi>God by nature,</hi> yet took upon him our fleſh, and gave that <hi>fleſh for the life of the world, Joh.</hi> 6.51. therefore it was not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Chriſt ſhould undergo that <hi>adjunct,</hi> the <hi>Eternity</hi> of puniſhment, becauſe he was able to ſatisfie the Juſtice of God by his ſufferings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuffering to Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As for that which we call the <hi>Worm of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> which is one thing in the puniſhment of the Damned, Chriſt could not undergo that, and the reaſon is, becauſe that which is called the <hi>worm of conſcience</hi> is an inſeparable adjunct of ſin inhering in the perſon in whom it is: now Chriſt was moſt free from ſin in his own perſon; it is true, he had ſin imputed to him, the guilt of our ſins was imputed to him, but he had no guilt of his own, and therefore he could not have this worm of conſcience; for that which we call the worm of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:99997:142"/>conſcience is nothing elſe but conſcience <hi>reflecting</hi> upon a mans actions, and tormenting him upon the account of the <hi>obliquity</hi> and <hi>deformity</hi> that hath appeared in them. Now Chriſt having done nothing that was contrary to the Law, <hi>He had done no violence, neither was guile found in his mouth,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. it was not poſſible he ſhould undergo the worm of conſcience, becauſe this ſuppoſeth ſin in the perſon that underwent it, which Chriſt was moſt free from.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As for that of <hi>Deſpair,</hi> ſome Divines are of opinion, that deſpair is not properly in the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the reaſon they give is this: As <hi>hope</hi> in the godly after the laſt Judgment ſhall ceaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hope ſhall then be ſwallowed up in <hi>fruition;</hi> ſo they ſuppoſe that deſpair ſhall ceaſe in the wicked, becauſe that perdition and deſtruction is then actually come upon them, which before they feared.</p>
                  <p>But it may be ſaid: Do not the Damned ſee that they are miſerable, and that they ſhall be miſerable for ever, and doth not this cauſe them to deſpair?</p>
                  <p>To this they anſwer: It is true, the Damned ſee themſelves in that miſery from which they ſhall never be delivered; but yet it may ſtill be doubted, whether this may be called Deſpair yea or no: and the reaſon is, ſay they, becauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair ſuppoſeth a ſenſe of ſome <hi>future time,</hi> but now in Eternity there is no time. The Damned have a certain knowledge of miſery that they are under, they feel it at the preſent, and therefore, ſay they, that which they do already feel they need not fear. Hence is that ſpeech of one of the Ancients: <hi>Grief hath no fear in it, becauſe fear
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:99997:143"/>doth no longer torment the mind, when a man begins already to ſuffer what he did fear.</hi> But I know not whether it be worth the while to diſpute, whether deſpair be properly in the Damned yea or no. This I am ſure of, that the Damned know that they are miſerable, and they know that this miſery ſhall continue always, they know that it ſhall not be otherwiſe with them than now it is, and this is equivalent unto deſpair; but this is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an adjunct of their <hi>torment</hi> and <hi>puniſhment,</hi> than the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it: therefore it was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Chriſt ſhould undergo it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſay, That <hi>deſpair,</hi> as it is oppoſite to the grace of <hi>hope,</hi> ſo it could not be in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe deſpair, at it is oppoſite to hope, ſpeaks a <hi>deordination,</hi> and it would ſuppoſe ſome ſin, which Chriſt was moſt free from; and therefore Chriſt, when he was in the very <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and height of all his ſufferings, when he had loſt the ſenſe and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods love, yet he manifeſted the higheſt faith, when he ſaith, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Though he had not the <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> of Gods love, but complains that he was <hi>forſaken,</hi> yet he calls God <hi>his God,</hi> and that manifeſted his faith, and where there is faith, there will be hope, for <hi>hope</hi> is the daughter of <hi>faith;</hi> therefore deſpair was not in Chriſt. But though Chriſt did not ſuffer ſome <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>adjuncts</hi> of puniſhment that the Damned ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, yet Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of what we were to ſuffer: and this is that which I muſt now begin to ſpeak unto. And here I am to ſhew how it was that Chriſt ſuffered the ſubſtance of what we ought to have ſuffered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt made himſelf paſſible and <hi>mortal</hi> for
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:99997:143"/>our ſakes, that is, he made himſelf ſubject to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and death for our ſakes. Sin is the <hi>inlet</hi> of ſuffering and death: had there been no ſin, there had been no ſuffering or death. It was ſin that brought in both <hi>ſuffering</hi> and <hi>death:</hi> when man had ſinned, God firſt ſaid to the woman, <hi>I will greatly multiply thy ſorrow, and thy conception, in ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth children, Gen.</hi> 3.16. To the man he ſaith, <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life, Gen.</hi> 3.17. Here we ſee <hi>ſin</hi> brought in <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>ſuffering,</hi> ſo alſo <hi>ſin</hi> brought in <hi>death, Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> Rom. 5.12. <hi>Wherefore as by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin.</hi> Now Chriſt our <hi>Surety,</hi> that he might bear the puniſhment that was due to us, he put himſelf into a ſtate of ſuffering and death for us, ſin ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving brought in ſuffering and death into the world as the juſt demerit of it, and the curſe that was due to it: Chriſt, I ſay, being our Surety put himſelf into a ſtate of ſuffering and death for us. To underſtand this, we muſt know, that although the Son of God had aſſumed our nature, yet he needed not, unleſs he had pleaſed, to have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected himſelf unto <hi>ſuffering</hi> and unto <hi>death.</hi> For Chriſt aſſuming our nature without ſin, was in reſpect of the innocency of his Humanity, and alſo in reſpect of the perſonal Union exempted both from the Law of ſuffering and of death; but Chriſt becoming our <hi>Surety,</hi> and being to bear the whole puniſhment that was due to us by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſin, and it being the <hi>nature</hi> of the Curſe,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we ſhould be liable to <hi>ſuffering</hi> and <hi>death;</hi> And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we ſhould <hi>actually undergo</hi> ſuffering
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:99997:144"/>and death; therefore Chriſt did voluntarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo both theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He did <hi>ſubject</hi> himſelf to a <hi>paſſible</hi> and <hi>mortal</hi> ſtate. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He did <hi>actually</hi> undergo <hi>ſuffering</hi> and <hi>death</hi> for us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt did ſubject himſelf to a <hi>paſſible eſtate;</hi> he that was above all ſuffering, made himſelf ſubject to ſuffering for our ſake. Hence is it ſaid, that he was <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief, Iſa.</hi> 53.3. Hence alſo is it ſaid, <hi>He was tempted in all points like unto us, ſin only excepted, Heb.</hi> 4.15. Chriſt was expoſed to all manner of ſufferings and temptations whatſoever excepting ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt did ſubject himſelf to a mortal eſtate for our ſakes.

When man by ſin was brought into a mortal ſtate, he was always in fear and expectation of death. A man that is <hi>condemned</hi> doth not dye preſently, but he is in a <hi>dying condition,</hi> and he is always in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death; and a man that is infected with the <hi>plague,</hi> doth not, it may be, dye preſently, but he carries his <hi>deaths wound</hi> about him: ſo man having ſinned, he had the <hi>matter</hi> of death in him, he had that in him, which would certainly and infallibly bring him unto death, man having ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned brought himſelf into a mortal ſtate: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our Surety, that he might deliver us from this part of the Curſe, put himſelf into a <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>mortality,</hi> makes himſelf liable to death. Hence is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. <hi>He took upon him the form of a ſervant, and became obedient to the death, even the death of the croſs:</hi> that is, he <hi>took our nature,</hi> and made himſelf <hi>mortal</hi> in it. Had the <hi>Divinity</hi> in Chriſt exerted it ſelf in its full power and ſtrength, it could have prevented ſuffering and death in Chriſt; but it being a part of the <hi>Curſe,</hi> that we ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Learn from hence, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> in the firſt place, the <hi>infinite love</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that Chriſt who was <hi>free,</hi> would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Surety, and bring himſelf under <hi>bonds</hi> for us, and make himſelf liable to the Law and to the penalty of it for our ſakes; yea not only ſo, that Chriſt who was moſt free, would take upon him the payment of our debt, but that he who in ſome reſpect was the <hi>Creditor,</hi> and had the <hi>debt</hi> owing to him, ſhould yet in <hi>another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,</hi> and in a wonderful way of <hi>diſpenſation</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>Surety,</hi> and pay the debt for us. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſt as <hi>God,</hi> ſin was an offence againſt him as well as againſt the other Perſons of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and Chriſt might have demanded and exacted puniſhment from men; but yet Chriſt in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful way of diſpenſation, by aſſuming our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and bearing the puniſhment due to us in it, would become our Surety, and pay the debt that was owing to himſelf. Have we not reaſon here, with the Apoſtle, to cry out, <hi>O the depth!

<pb n="273" facs="tcp:99997:145"/>ſatisfaction <hi>from us,</hi> he was pleaſed to take our nature, and make ſatisfaction for us.</p>
                  <p>This ſhews us the <hi>great happineſs</hi> and the <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar priviledge</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> who have an intereſt in Chriſt. The priviledge of Believers lies in this, That Chriſt who is their Surety, hath undertaken to ſatisfie and diſcharge their debt for them. Now if the debt of puniſhment which we owe to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice be already ſatisfied, if the puniſhment which we owe to Gods Juſtice be already under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, Divine Juſtice can demand no more: this conſideration may be of unſpeakable uſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to us when we come to be under <hi>agonies</hi> and terrors of conſcience.

Holy Souls themſelves have had ſome ſips and taſtes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath. Now that which may be of unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able comfort in ſuch a caſe is this: If thou be a true Believer, if thou haſt cloſed with Chriſt by faith, thou haſt already ſuffered puniſhment in Chriſt thy Head, thou haſt after a ſort <hi>ſatisfied</hi> Divine Juſtice, and born the torments of Hell in Chriſt thy Head. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, Gal.</hi> 2.20.

                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> and <hi>we are made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> Now thou that art a true ſincere Believer, who loveſt Chriſt, and prizeſt him above all the world, if thou haſt

If Chriſt hath <hi>dyed,</hi> thou ſhalt not dye; and if Chriſt hath been <hi>condemned,</hi> thou ſhalt not be condemned.</p>
                  <p>This ſhews the unſpeakable miſery of ſuch who have no intereſt in Chriſt, <label type="milestone">

As this is the ſingular priviledge of Believers, that they are exempted from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe Chriſt their Head and Surety hath born it for them: ſo this is the unſpeakable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of all Unbelievers, of all ſuch as lye out of Chriſt, that they are liable to bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their own ſins, becauſe they have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in that perſon that ſhould take off this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from them.

                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> ſtands in full force againſt them, that <hi>Law</hi> that ſays, <hi>The ſoul that ſins ſhall dye.

                  <p n="1">1. Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he might bear the puniſhment of our ſins, underwent all manner of ſufferings in his <hi>body</hi> for us, he ſuffered <hi>hunger, thirſt, wearineſs, pain, grief,</hi> and the like, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.4. <hi>He hath born our grief, and carried our ſorrows:</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>He was oppreſſed, and he was afflicted.</hi> Whatever <hi>preſſures</hi> and <hi>loads</hi> of afflictions we may feel, Chriſt felt the ſame, yea he hath felt them in a far greater meaſure than we do.

By theſe expreſſions, <hi>Learned men</hi> obſerve, That all the <hi>miſeries</hi> and <hi>calamities</hi> of this life are ſet forth; this was part of the <hi>Curſe,</hi> that man ſhould be ſubject to all the miſeries of this life, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries that we all feel and experiment, ſuch as <hi>hunger, wearineſs, pain,</hi> and the like.

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:99997:147"/>to all theſe miſeries, Chriſt underwent the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that we are ſubject unto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt was <hi>expoſed</hi> unto, and ſuffered <hi>ſhame, ignominy, contempt,</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> for our ſakes. Hence was it, that he was arraigned and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a <hi>Malefactor</hi> by an <hi>earthly Judge:</hi> hence it came to paſs, that he was <hi>buffeted, reviled, ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, crowned with thorns, mocked, derided, crucified between two thieves,</hi> all which circumſtances were matter of great reproach and contempt, and all this our Saviour bare as the puniſhment of our ſins, and we cannot have a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>due</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the ſufferings of Chriſt, what they are in themſelves, nor make the right uſe of them as to our ſelves, unleſs we apprehend, that whatever Chriſt ſuffered, he ſuffered it as the puniſhment for our ſins. We read in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel what ſhame and contempt was poured on our Saviour, in his being buffeted, ſpit upon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided, mocked, and crowned with thorns; but I fear there are too few that conſider, that he bare theſe things as the juſt puniſhment of our ſins. We read this as a Hiſtory, and that is all; but if we look upon this with a <hi>ſpiritual eye,</hi> we ought to conſider, that our Saviour bare all this as the juſt puniſhment of our ſins; for ſhame and contempt is one part of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> due to ſin. Hence is it, that when the puniſhment of the wicked is deſcribed at the laſt Day, it is deſcribed by this, <hi>Some ſhall riſe to ſhame and everlaſting contempt, Dan.</hi> 12.2. ſo that ſhame and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contempt is part of the puniſhment that is due to ſin. Now then our Saviour bearing the <hi>whole puniſhment</hi> of our ſins, hath born that <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>contempt</hi> that we deſerve. Hence are thoſe
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:99997:148"/>expreſſions, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>That he gave his back to the ſmiters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, he hid not his face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Chriſt ſuffered in his <hi>Soul,</hi> as well as in his body, for us; yea, our <hi>Saviours</hi> ſufferings in his Soul were his <hi>greateſt ſufferings.</hi> Though the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his <hi>body</hi> were <hi>great,</hi> yet the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of his Soul were by far the greateſt ſufferings, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled.</hi> Mat. 26.28. <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful.</hi> The <hi>Papiſts</hi> and ſome others will not admit theſe ſufferings of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in his Soul, they make the main of Chriſts ſufferings to be in his body. But the <hi>Scripture</hi> is clear in this, That Chriſt ſuffered in his <hi>Soul</hi> as well as in his <hi>body;</hi> and it was moſt neceſſary, that Chriſt, who was our Surety, ſhould ſuffer in his Soul as well as in his body: and the reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> did <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>principally</hi> ſin in his ſoul: <hi>ſin</hi> firſt <hi>began</hi> in the <hi>ſoul;</hi> and therefore it was meet, that Chriſt ſhould <hi>primarily</hi> and <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi> ſuffer in his Soul that puniſhment that was due to us for our ſins. It is the obſervation of a <hi>Learned man,</hi> Chriſt, ſaith he, is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the notion of a <hi>Surety,</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker</hi> for us: Thence, ſaith he, it follows, that his <hi>body</hi> was conſtituted and appointed as a Surety for our <hi>body,</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> was conſtituted a Surety for our <hi>ſouls:</hi> ſo that Chriſt was to ſuffer that puniſhment in his <hi>Soul,</hi> that we were to ſuffer in our <hi>ſouls,</hi> and Chriſt was to undergo that puniſhment in his <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> that we were to ſuffer in our <hi>bodies;</hi> and if we ſhould ſuppoſe, that our Saviour had not ſuffered that in his Soul which we ſhould have ſuffered, but only hath ſuffered ſuch grief as belongs to the ſenſitive part, then it would follow, that the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:99997:148"/>Soul or Spirit that is in us, is not yet <hi>redeemed;</hi> for what Chriſt hath not born for us, doth remain ſtill for us to ſuffer and to be undergone. If therefore Chriſt ſuffered nothing in his <hi>Soul</hi> of what the Law of God and Divine Juſtice would inflict upon our <hi>ſpirits</hi> and <hi>ſouls</hi> as the puniſhment of ſin, it remains ſtill to be undergone by us. But much more ſweet and comfortable is that ſpeech of <hi>Ambroſe: My mind or ſpirit is crucified in Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mens mea in Chriſto crucifixa eſt.</hi> Ambr.</note> the meaning of which I take to be, That the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which was due to my <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>ſpirit</hi> is laid upon Chriſt, and I having ſuffered that in my <hi>mind</hi> or <hi>ſpirit,</hi> in Chriſt my <hi>Head,</hi> which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to ſuffer, I hope hereby to be ſet free from that puniſhment. Chriſt, I ſay, ſuffered in his Soul: hence is it ſaid, that Chriſt <hi>was ſmitten of God, Iſa.</hi> 53.4. We did eſteem him <hi>ſtricken, ſmitten of God,</hi> and it pleaſed <hi>the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief, verſ.</hi> 10. Chriſt was <hi>ſtricken of God,</hi> immediately ſtricken in his Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.26. <hi>They perſecute him whom thou haſt ſmitten.</hi> Mat. 26.31. <hi>I will ſmite the ſhepherd.</hi> If Chriſt was ſmitten of God, how ſhould that be but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in his Soul? Hence is that of one of the Ancients: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was juſtly angry with us for our ſins, and Chriſt interpoſing himſelf as the middle perſon, took off the ſtroke, and bare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that hung over us.</hi> Neither may it ſeem ſtrange to us, that our Saviour ſhould ſuffer in his Soul, for as much as he was pleaſed to take upon him the guilt of all our ſins. It is a memorable paſſage of a late modern Divine: <hi>The guilt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dickson. Therapeut Sacr.</note> ſaith he, <hi>of all our ſins, wickedneſſes, and moſt hainous offences, which from the beginning of the world to the end of it have been committed by any of the Elect, all
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:99997:149"/>theſe were imputed to one Chriſt, altogether, and all at once; and although Chriſt by taking the guilt of all theſe ſins upon him, did not pollute or defile that holy Soul of his, yet nevertheleſs he did burthen his Soul with them, by obliging himſelf to ſuffer the puniſhment that was due to the ſins of the Elect, as if ſo be thoſe very ſins had in ſome ſort been his own ſins. Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whenas we ſee the moſt profligate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure ſinners, lyars, thieves, adulterers, and the like, when we ſee theſe, they cannot patiently hear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be called lyars, or thieves, or adulterers, though guilty of ſuch enormous crimes, although it is manifeſt that they are guilty of them, neither can they bear the ſhame and diſgrace of their own guilt that yet doth manifeſtly lye upon them; with how great a grief and paſſion of mind, with how great a darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that ſanctity and glory that was in our Saviour, muſt we ſuppoſe that Chriſt did take upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this moſt noiſom dunghil of all our ſins, than which nothing could be more abhorring from the purity and ſanctity of nature!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt ſuffered <hi>death</hi> it ſelf for us: hence is it ſaid, <hi>That he taſted death for everyman, Heb.</hi> 2.9. Nothing leſs than <hi>death</hi> could ſatisfie the Law, the ſentence of the Law was, That <hi>the ſoul that ſins ſhall dye;</hi> therefore he that will be our ſurety, and bear the puniſhment due to us, muſt undergo death it ſelf for us. Some of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> tell us, That ſuch was the dignity of Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the leaſt drop of his Blood, the leaſt tear, the leaſt ſigh of his heart would have been ſufficient to redeem us. But our <hi>Divines</hi> do well anſwer: To what purpoſe then were all the reſt of Chriſts ſufferings, his <hi>temptations,</hi> his <hi>grief,</hi> his <hi>reproaches,</hi> and all that which he underwent both
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:99997:149"/>in his life and death? If one <hi>drop</hi> of Chriſts blood had been ſufficient to redeem us, then all the reſt that Chriſt ſuffered, muſt needs be ſuppoſed to be ſuperfluous and unneceſſary. But we muſt know, that notwithſtanding the dignity of Chriſts perſon, the Law requires <hi>death, In the day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> demanded the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be undergone, which was threatned by the Law; therefore <hi>death</hi> being threatned by the Law, nothing leſs than death would ſatisfie <hi>Divine Juſtice.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> That under the <hi>Law,</hi> without ſhedding of blood there was no <hi>remiſſion;</hi> the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> muſt be <hi>killed</hi> and <hi>ſlain</hi> before there could be remiſſion of ſins. Chriſt therefore being the <hi>true Sacrifice</hi> for our ſins, he was to be <hi>ſlain</hi> and put to death, before remiſſion of ſins could be obtained for us. It is true, there were many advantages that did accrue by the <hi>dignity</hi> of Chriſts perſon, ſome of which are ſuch as theſe, which <hi>Divines</hi> mention.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the death of <hi>one</hi> ſhould be ſufficient for the Redemption of ſo many. If Chriſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had not been of that <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>worth,</hi> it could not have been ſuppoſed, that the death and ſuffering of <hi>one perſon</hi> would have ſufficed for the Redemption of <hi>ſo many.</hi> It is well obſerved by one of the Ancients: <hi>If Chriſt had not been God, how could he alone have been ſufficient to have been a price for our Redemption?</hi> Therefore there is that advantage which ariſeth from the dignity of Chriſts perſon, that the excellency of his perſon is ſuch, he being an <hi>infinite perſon,</hi> that he is able to make ſatisfaction for all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>dignity</hi> of Chriſts perſon made the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:99997:150"/>death of Chriſt to be <hi>meritorious;</hi> for what may we not ſuppoſe, that ſo great a Perſon, who was of equal Majeſty and Glory with the Father, ſhould not merit at the hand of his Father?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The dignity of Chriſts perſon was available as to this, That ſome <hi>circumſtances</hi> of <hi>puniſhment,</hi> which were not fit for him to undergo, Chriſt undergoing that which was <hi>equivalent,</hi> might be omitted; as one <hi>circumſtance</hi> which <hi>Divines</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this, namely, That the torments of Hell, which were to be ſuffered and undergone by us in the next life, were ſuffered and undergone by Chriſt in this life. Theſe advantages did accrue from the dignity of Chriſts perſon; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this dignity of Chriſts perſon, he that was to be our <hi>Surety</hi> was to undergo the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of that puniſhment that we were to undergo. Now <hi>death</hi> being the puniſhment that was to be ſuffered by the tranſgreſſors of the Law, as being threatned by the Law, Chriſt being our Surety, was to undergo and ſuffer death for us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Chriſt did not only undergo <hi>natural</hi> death, but he alſo taſted of <hi>ſupernatural</hi> death, and ſo by conſequence ſuffered the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>torments</hi> of Hell for us. Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>whole</hi> curſe of the Law as to the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of it. Hence is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3.13. Now the <hi>Curſe</hi> of the Law was, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi> or as it may be rendred, <hi>In dying thou ſhalt dye,</hi> that is, <hi>thou ſhalt dye doubly,</hi> thou ſhalt dye a <hi>twofold death,</hi> thou ſhalt dye <hi>naturally,</hi> and thou ſhalt dye <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> thou ſhalt dye a <hi>natural death,</hi> in having thy <hi>ſoul ſeparated</hi> from thy <hi>body,</hi> and thou ſhalt dye a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:99997:150"/>death,</hi> in having thy ſoul ſeparated from me. Therefore it is well obſerved by one of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> I think it is <hi>Ambroſe</hi>'s obſervation; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith he, it was ſaid to <hi>Adam, In dying thou ſhalt dye,</hi> or as it is rendred, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> and not ſimply, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye,</hi> becauſe the death here ſpoken of concerns both <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body.</hi> Now then as <hi>Adam,</hi> and we in him, became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a double death, one of the body, the other of the ſoul: So our Saviour being pleaſed to be our Surety, ſubjected himſelf to a double death for our ſakes, to a <hi>natural</hi> death, and to a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To a natural death, the <hi>ſeparation</hi> of his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul</hi> from his <hi>body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. To a ſupernatural and ſpiritual death, the <hi>ſeparation</hi> of his <hi>ſoul</hi> for a time from the <hi>comfort</hi> of Gods <hi>preſence.</hi> Hence is it that we read, that our Saviour did not only ſuffer <hi>death</hi> in the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar number, but he underwent <hi>deaths</hi> in the Plural number, as if it were intimated, that there was a <hi>double</hi> death that he ſuffered, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.9. <hi>He made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death,</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> it is in his <hi>deaths</hi> in the Plural number; and this was not without ſome ſpecial Myſtery in it, as ſome Learned men conceive: yea, there is a <hi>judicious Divine</hi> that ſaith expreſly, he is perſwaded, that both kind of <hi>deaths, natural</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> are intimated by that expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it is ſaid, <hi>He made his grave with the rich in his deaths.</hi> Our Saviour underwent therefore a double death, a natural death and a ſupernatural death. That our Saviour ſuffered the firſt death, a natural death, a ſeparation of his humane ſoul from his body, that we do all know and believe.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:99997:151"/>Now that he taſted of the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> or ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death, the ſeparation of his ſoul from God (taken in a right ſenſe) that I muſt ſpeak unto. To underſtand this we muſt know, that the ſoul may be ſaid to be ſeparated from God two ways.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By a <hi>voluntary averſion</hi> from God by ſin, this was not in our Saviour, and could not be in him, his will did always <hi>firmly</hi> and <hi>inſeparably adhere</hi> to God even in the midſt of his greateſt ſufferings. It is true, this is part of the puniſhment of ſin in us, namely, that our wills are turned aſide from God, <hi>Adam voluntarily</hi> deſerting of God, this is now part of the puniſhment that is come upon him, that he is now <hi>left to himſelf,</hi> and thereupon there is an <hi>averſion</hi> of his will from God, and this is that which we call <hi>ſpiritual Death,</hi> when the will declines and turns from God, the <hi>chief Good.</hi> But this kind of <hi>death</hi> could not be in our Saviour, and the reaſon is, becauſe he that was to bear the puniſhment of all other mens ſins, muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed to be without all ſin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Chriſt could not have been a Surety for our ſins, born the puniſhment of them, if he had not been without all ſin himſelf. This averſion of the ſoul from God, as it is the <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſin, ſo it is in it ſelf a ſin. Now Chriſt ſo bears the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſins, as that he himſelf is ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſin in a way of <hi>inheſion.</hi> Chriſt hath the guilt of our ſins laid upon him by way of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but he hath no ſin in him by way of <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſoul may be ſaid to be ſeparated from God in a way of <hi>deprivation,</hi> namely, when the ſoul is deprived of the <hi>comfort</hi> of Gods <hi>love</hi> and <hi>preſence.</hi> Now this our Saviour did undergo, he
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:99997:151"/>was deprived of the <hi>comfort</hi> of his Fathers <hi>love</hi> and <hi>preſence</hi> for a time, as we ſhall ſhew more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.14. <hi>Lord, why caſteſt thou off my ſoul? why hideſt thou thy face from me?</hi> This is ſpoken in the <hi>letter</hi> in the perſon of <hi>Heman;</hi> but <hi>Learned</hi> men conceive, that Chriſts ſufferings are here repreſented to us under theſe expreſſions: <hi>Lord, why hideſt thou thy face from me?</hi> Gods face was hid from Chriſt for a time, that ſo it might not be hid from us for ever. And this was the <hi>ſpiritual death</hi> that our Saviour underwent, not a death <hi>in ſin,</hi> which <hi>we</hi> are all ſubject to; not any <hi>averſion</hi> of his will from God, but <hi>deſertion</hi> of God in point of <hi>comfort;</hi> to be <hi>deſerted</hi> and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> was, is in ſome ſenſe the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> death of the ſoul. It is a good ſpeech of one of the Ancients: <hi>That is not death ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that ſeparates the ſoul from the body; but that is moſt properly death, which ſeparates the ſoul from God.</hi> God is <hi>life,</hi> life it ſelf; he therefore that is ſeparated from God muſt needs be dead; as the body lives from the ſoul, ſo the ſoul, <hi>ut beatè vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat,</hi> that it may live happily, muſt live from God. Hence are thoſe expreſſions of <hi>Auſtin: The life of the body is the ſoul, but the life of the ſoul is God; the body dyes, when the ſoul recedes from it, and the ſoul dyes, when God recedes from it.</hi> Therefore when our Saviour was ſo far <hi>forſaken</hi> and <hi>deſerted</hi> of God for our ſakes, as to have no <hi>ſenſible taſte</hi> of his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>favour</hi> for a time, in this ſenſe he underwent ſpiritual and ſupernatural death for us.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The ſixth Particular which follows upon this is, That our <hi>Saviour</hi> taſting of <hi>ſupernatural death</hi> for us, he did in ſo doing undergo the <hi>very
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:99997:152"/>pains</hi> of Hell for us. Hence are thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.3. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me, the pains of hell got hold of me, I found trouble and ſorrow.</hi> So likewiſe, <hi>My ſoul is heavy to the death, Mat.</hi> 26.38. It is a great expreſſion which we have,

Thoſe which he had in the Garden, when he was in his <hi>Agony,</hi> and when he ſweat <hi>drops</hi> of <hi>blood,</hi> and thoſe which he had upon the Croſs, when he cryed out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Theſe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>ſorrows</hi> or <hi>pains</hi> of death, but indeed they were the ſorrows or pains of Hell; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>vulgar Latin</hi> renders it, <hi>the pains of hell,</hi> becauſe in theſe ſorrows our Saviour did not only taſte of the <hi>ſorrows</hi> of <hi>natural death,</hi> but he alſo taſted of the <hi>ſorrows</hi> of <hi>ſupernatural death,</hi> that is, of the pains of Hell. Hence is it, as <hi>Learned men</hi> have obſerved, That the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt, and thoſe <hi>great ſorrows</hi> that he underwent, are ſet forth in ſuch a variety and multitude of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that ſometimes they are ſet forth by the <hi>grave,</hi> by <hi>darkneſs,</hi> ſometimes by the land of <hi>oblivion,</hi> ſometimes they are called <hi>wounding, killing;</hi> ſometimes they are ſet forth by his being <hi>forſaken,</hi> forſaken of his <hi>friends,</hi> of his <hi>kindred,</hi> yea of <hi>God</hi> himſelf: ſometimes they are called <hi>debts, afflictions, tempeſts, ſolitude, priſon, cuting off, abjection, treading under foot;</hi> all which, and many more which the Scripture is full of, ſets forth thoſe moſt <hi>perfect, conſummate,</hi> and <hi>compleat</hi> ſorrows and pains which our Saviour did ſuffer and undergo for our ſake. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. which is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:99997:152"/>certainly a <hi>Prophecy</hi> of Chriſt, and a deſcription of his ſufferings, we have theſe ſufferings notably ſet forth, in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>I am poured out like water, all my bones are out of joynt, my heart is like wax, it is melted in the midſt of my bowels, my ſtrength is dryed up like a potſherd, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws, and thou haſt brought me into the duſt of death.</hi> He that thinks this is ſpoken of ſome <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſufferings,</hi> which are common to other men, muſt needs have a very <hi>ſlender conſideration</hi> of theſe things, certainly they are more than <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ordinary</hi> ſorrows that drew ſuch <hi>expreſſions</hi> from our Saviour, in whoſe <hi>perſon</hi> here the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſpeaks: our Saviour then taſted of <hi>ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death,</hi> he did undergo the <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> for us. Now that I may unfold a little more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and diſtinctly how it was that Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>torments</hi> of Hell for us, I muſt do it in ſome particular Propoſitions, and I would ſpeak of this a little for theſe two ends.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That we might more fully underſtand what it was that we <hi>deſerved</hi> by our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That we might admire the love of Chriſt ſo much the more, that he ſhould ſuffer ſuch pains and torments for us, that we might be delivered from them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>I Come now to ſpeak particularly of that which was formerly mentioned in the general, and here we ſhall ſhew</p>
                  <p n="1">1. How it was that our Saviour ſuffered <hi>fear,</hi> and what the <hi>fear</hi> was that he underwent.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew how it was that he ſuffered <hi>grief,</hi> becauſe theſe are the <hi>two things</hi> which the Evangeliſt inſiſts upon in the <hi>Text</hi> formerly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> was afflicted with <hi>ſore fear,</hi> yea he was even <hi>overwhelmed</hi> and <hi>oppreſſed</hi> by <hi>fear,</hi> yet <hi>without</hi> ſin: hence is that expreſſion of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>He was heard in that he feared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here it may be ſaid,
<note place="margin">Object.</note> What was that <hi>fear</hi> that our Saviour was ſtruck with, when he is ſaid to be <hi>amazed</hi> with fear, or <hi>aſtoniſhed</hi> with fear?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer,
<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> It was the <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>horror</hi> of <hi>Divine wrath</hi> due to us for our ſins. Certainly it was not a corporal death that our Saviour feared ſo much; many of the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> by the Grace they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, were much carried above the fear of a <hi>corporal death;</hi> much more may we ſuppoſe, that the <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>conſummate</hi> Grace that was in the heart of our Saviour, would have carried him above the fear of a natural death: but it was the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:99997:155"/>fear of Divine wrath that he was ſtruck with; therefore is it that he crys out, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me.</hi> What was this cup? Certainly the cup of Divine wrath, as I may ſhew you more hereafter: this then was that which our Saviour feared, the <hi>wrath</hi> of God. <hi>Fear,</hi> ſays a Learned man, <hi>was caſt into the humane nature of our Saviour, which being a creature, fear might poſſeſs it, leſt it ſhould be ſwallowed up of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry God, who did exact as much as rigid juſtice ought or could require from ſo great a perſon who was the Surety or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaker.</hi> Our Saviour knew right-well that he was to bear, not the guilt of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> or a <hi>few</hi> ſins, not the guilt of ſome leſſer ſins only, but the guilt of the greateſt ſins; he knew that he was to bear the guilt, not of the ſins of ſome of the Elect only, but the guilt of all the ſins of all the Elect; what a <hi>torrent</hi> then, or <hi>ſea</hi> rather of wrath muſt our Saviour needs ſee coming on his moſt holy Soul, when the wrath of God, which was due for the ſins of all the Elect, was like to come upon him at once? Well therefore might he be <hi>afraid.</hi> If it be poſſible for <hi>Satan</hi> to <hi>aggravate</hi> and <hi>blow up</hi> the guilt of a <hi>little</hi> ſin (as we would account it) in the eye of a mans conſcience, ſo as it ſhall ſeem the greateſt ſin in all the world, as certainly he can, and thoſe that have to do with troubled conſciences, know how often he doth it, and ſuch a ſin is ready to make a ſoul to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, unleſs Divine Grace do ſtep in and help it; into what a conſternation then may we well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the humane ſoul of our Saviour to be caſt, when the ſins of all the Elect, the moſt great, horrid, and hainous ſins, as well as the leaſt, were bound upon him by the omnipotent hand of God
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:99997:156"/>his Father, and he knew he was to anſwer for them all? well might our Saviour <hi>fear</hi> in this caſe. Neither is it to be wondred at, that our Saviour ſhould be thus ſtruck with fear and aſtoniſhment, if we conſider that Chriſt did not only take our <hi>nature,</hi> but he took the <hi>infirmities</hi> of our nature, namely, ſuch as were <hi>inculpable</hi> and without ſin, and he alſo aſſumed our <hi>natural affections,</hi> as <hi>grief, ſorrow,</hi> and the like. It is <hi>natural</hi> to the creature to <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>tremble</hi> at the <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>preſence</hi> of an <hi>angry God:</hi> thus we read how the <hi>rocks clave</hi> in ſunder, and the <hi>mountains</hi> have trembled when God hath ſhewn forth the <hi>terribleneſs</hi> of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty;</hi> and it is <hi>natural</hi> to men, when any terrible object preſents it ſelf, and ſome evil approaches, although it be not as yet inflicted, eſpecially when ſome ſuch evil approches, as is greater than a mans ſtrength, to fear and be aſtoniſhed: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour having the <hi>verity</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of our nature in him, and having the <hi>verity</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>humane paſſions</hi> in him, yet without ſin, having the moſt terrible object that ever was, ſet before him, and that which would have been too great for him to bear, had he been but <hi>meer man,</hi> and that is the <hi>wrath</hi> of the <hi>great God</hi> due to the ſins of all the Elect, well might he be aſtoniſhed and fear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Saviour was oppreſſed with <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> as well as <hi>fear. Fear</hi> is ſuch a <hi>paſſion</hi> as ariſeth from ſome <hi>imminent</hi> or <hi>impending</hi> evil, <hi>grief</hi> is a paſſion that ariſeth from ſome <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted evil.</hi> Fear is the <hi>expectation</hi> of ſome <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture evil,</hi> grief is that which ariſeth from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of ſome <hi>preſent</hi> evil. Now our Saviour had not only <hi>fear,</hi> but <hi>grief;</hi> he <hi>felt</hi> that in his moſt
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:99997:156"/>
                     <hi>holy Soul</hi> which was cauſe of <hi>greateſt grief</hi> and <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> to him. This is ſet forth by the Evangeliſt <hi>Matthew, Mat.</hi> 26.37.

Certainly, had our Saviours ſorrows been but <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ordinary,</hi> he would not have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of them to his Diſciples; but ſo great was his ſorrow, that he is fain to ſeek for a little eaſe, by venting himſelf to his Diſciples.

Yet that is not all, but he adds farther, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death.</hi> So great was his grief and ſorrow before he came to the Croſs, and the ſufferings that he underwent there, that the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of his
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:99997:157"/>grief and ſorrow had almoſt brought him to death before-hand; yea, we may well ſuppoſe, that had not our Saviour had the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> to ſupport him, the ſtrength of his ſorrows in the <hi>Garden,</hi> before he came to the Croſs, might have taken away his <hi>natural life.</hi> He ſaith, his ſoul was <hi>heavy to the very death.</hi> We ſee how many are killed with grief, when grief and ſorrow riſes to a great height, many have had their natural ſpirits ſuppreſſed, and <hi>dyed</hi> away under it. Now our Saviours ſorrows did far exceed the ſorrows of all other men: yea, if all mens ſorrows were put together, our Saviours ſorrows exceeded them all; and the reaſon is, becauſe he ſuſtained the perſon of all the Elect, and he bare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only of a few ſins, but of all the ſins of all his people at once. Therefore if he had not had the power of the Divinity to have ſupported him, the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of his ſorrows might have ſunk him, and brought him down to death; but having other things to ſuffer upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> beſides thoſe things he ſuffered in the <hi>Garden,</hi> he was not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful unto <hi>death abſolutely,</hi> that is, not ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſo as to <hi>dye</hi> in and by thoſe ſorrows; but yet he was <hi>ſorrowful next</hi> to <hi>death,</hi> ſetting aſide death it ſelf, his ſorrow and grief in the Garden was ſo great, as it could not have been greater, even in death it ſelf, <hi>My ſoul is ſorrowful unto death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have ſhewed how our Saviour ſuffered a great deal of <hi>anxiety</hi> and <hi>perplexity</hi> in his mind in reſpect of <hi>fear,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>grief;</hi> but this is only in general. But to come a little nearer the matter, and the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our Saviour conflicted with the ſenſe of Gods <hi>wrath</hi> in his ſoul. I have ſhewed how he
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:99997:157"/>ſuffered the greateſt <hi>anxiety, perplexity,</hi> and <hi>grief</hi> in his mind. Now I ſhall ſhew how the great <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows</hi> our Saviour underwent did ariſe from the conflict he had with Gods wrath in his ſoul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this cup paſs from me.</hi> What cup was this? Truly the cup of Divine wrath. <hi>The cup of God is the wrath of God,
<note place="margin">Calix Dei, ira Dei eſt, ira Dei ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta eſt vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicta quae imponitur à juſto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</note> the wrath of God is the juſt revenge which is inflicted by a juſt Judge for our ſins,</hi> and this is the cup our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour drank of: our Saviour, that he might bear the puniſhment that was due to us for our ſins, taſted of the wrath of God, conflicted with the ſenſe of Gods wrath. The better to take in this we muſt conſider, that the ſenſe of Divine wrath is <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> that is due to us for our ſins, yea it is a <hi>principal</hi> part of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and a great part of the pains and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Hell conſiſts in it. It is a ſpeech of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The greateſt temptation of all others, is that temptation by which God is ſet in direct oppoſition to a man, and appears contrary to him.
<note place="margin">Quâ Deus contrarius homini po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitur.</note> This tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is an unſupportable temptation, and is properly Hell it ſelf,</hi> and no man can tell how great this temptation is, but he that hath felt it. Now when a man is under the ſenſe of Gods wrath, he apprehends God to be contrary to him, and to be ſet in direct oppoſition againſt him, and as was ſaid, this is part of the puniſhment that is due to us for ſin. Obſerve what is ſpoken to this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9. <hi>But to hem that are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, upon every ſoul of man that doth evil.</hi> The Apoſtle is here ſpeaking what is the puniſhment that ſhall come upon men for ſin, now he deſcribes it by
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:99997:158"/>this, <hi>Indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh.</hi> Now by theſe expreſſions, <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh,</hi> I conceive the Apoſtle doth not only intend the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Divine wrath,</hi> all the <hi>miſeries</hi> that ſhall be laid upon the damned, as the <hi>effects</hi> of <hi>Divine wrath;</hi> but he alſo intends the <hi>impreſſion</hi> of <hi>Divine wrath</hi> upon the conſcience of the ſinner: and therefore he expreſſeth it by ſo many words that intimate ſo much, <hi>indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh:</hi> theſe words plainly intimate the <hi>horror</hi> and <hi>anguiſh</hi> that ſhall be upon the ſpirit of the damned, and whence doth this <hi>tribulation</hi> and <hi>anguiſh</hi> ariſe? certainly from the fenſe of Gods wrath. When our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> had ſinned, God appeared to them as an <hi>angry</hi> God, in an <hi>angry manner:</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Haſt thou eaten of the tree whereof I ſaid thou ſhalt not eat?</hi> and to the Woman he ſaid, <hi>What is this that thou haſt done?</hi> Both theſe are expreſſions of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. When therefore man had ſinned, God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to him as an angry God. Now our Saviour being to take upon him the guilt of our ſins, he was to conflict with the ſenſe of Gods wrath, and therefore he had <hi>great</hi> and <hi>deep apprehenſions</hi> faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon his ſoul concerning the diſpleaſure that was due from God to us by reaſon of ſin. Chriſt, when he came to ſuffer for our ſins, ſaw the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice</hi> of God <hi>armed</hi> with <hi>revenge</hi> againſt us for our ſins, he ſaw the Juſtice of God ready to take hold on him as our Surety, who had taken upon him the guilt of our ſins. There is a <hi>Learned man,</hi> who is no friend to the Soul ſufferings of Chriſt, but makes it his buſineſs to oppoſe them, that yet in diſcuſſing that argument, is at laſt brought to this confeſſion: <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in his ſufferings
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:99997:158"/>had a preſent ſight of the Divine Majeſty, ſitting as it were in Judgment, and armed with the infinite power of Divine Juſtice to avenge the ſins of men.</hi> This is the confeſſion of an <hi>Adverſary</hi> that oppoſes the <hi>Soul-ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt. Now they which do aſſert the Soul-ſufferings of Chriſt do only add thus much more, That Chriſt did not only ſee Gods wrath that was due to us for our ſins, but he <hi>taſted</hi> of it, and <hi>felt</hi> it, and <hi>conflicted</hi> with the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of it; for to what purpoſe ſhould he <hi>ſee</hi> it and not <hi>feel</hi> it? Or how could Chriſts <hi>ſeeing</hi> the weight of Divine wrath that was due to us, and not <hi>bearing</hi> it, have expiated and taken away the guilt of our ſins? The ſenſe of <hi>Divine wrath</hi> was that which was due to us as the puniſhment of ſin; for the Law ſaith, <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all things.</hi> Now the <hi>Curſe</hi> is a <hi>certain token</hi> of <hi>loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>deteſtation</hi> in the perſon who is the Author of it: the Curſe ſpeaks <hi>utmoſt diſpleaſure</hi> in him that pronounceth it. No man curſeth another, but he that hath the utmoſt diſpleaſure againſt him; Chriſt therefore being our <hi>Surety,</hi> we muſt ſuppoſe that he did conteſt with the <hi>utmoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure</hi> of God, ſo much as a <hi>finite nature,</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by an <hi>infinite Perſon,</hi> could undergo. Hence is it, that we read of our Saviours being in an <hi>agony, Luk.</hi> 22.44. <hi>Being in an agony he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood, falling down to the ground.</hi> This is a great Text to ſet forth the ſufferings of our Saviour, and therefore we muſt a little ſpeak to it: and here we have two things to be conſidered.</p>

                  <p>The third Particular is this: That our Saviour ſuffered ſpiritual <hi>dereliction</hi> and <hi>deſertion</hi> in his Soul in point of comfort. This is a <hi>ſublime Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,</hi> and requires our moſt diligent <hi>attention.</hi> Divines obſerve, That Chriſt began to <hi>taſte</hi> of the <hi>Cup</hi> of Gods wrath in the Garden, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with the ſenſe of that wrath that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching to him; but he drank this cup <hi>fully off</hi> in his ſufferings upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> in that which is commonly called his <hi>dereliction,</hi> and <hi>being made a curſe for us.</hi> In theſe two things, Chriſts <hi>dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual deſertion,</hi> and his being <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us, the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>
                  <p>That which I am firſt to ſpeak of is his <hi>dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> or being <hi>forſaken</hi> of God. That our Saviour ſuffered this <hi>dereliction</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual deſertion</hi> appears from thoſe words of his upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> where he crys out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:99997:163"/>that is due to us for our ſins. That which I am ſhewing is, how Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>pains</hi> of Hell, and by ſuffering them, made ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Gods Juſtice for us: now this <hi>dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> or <hi>deſertion</hi> is one part of the pains of Hell.

<note place="margin">Privatio viſionis &amp; fruitionis Divinae.</note> 
                     <hi>That it is a deprivation of the Divine viſion and fruition:</hi> not but that the damned are deprived of all other <hi>comforts</hi> and <hi>good things,</hi> but the <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>fruition of God</hi> comprehends all the reſt; being deprived of the <hi>ſight</hi> and <hi>fruition</hi> of God, the <hi>chief good,</hi> they muſt neceſſarily be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the comfort of other <hi>particular goods.</hi> Now this <hi>deprivation</hi> of the <hi>ſight</hi> of God being part of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> that is due to us for our ſins, this <hi>pain of loſs</hi> our Saviour underwent for us in his <hi>dereliction</hi> and <hi>deſertion.</hi> His humane ſoul was deprived of that <hi>clear ſight</hi> and <hi>viſion</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> for a time.

                     <pb n="309" facs="tcp:99997:163"/>his humane ſoul was deprived of the ſight of God for a time. <hi>Divines</hi> are wont commonly to ſay, That Chriſt, from the moment of his conception, had the ſight of God, his <hi>humane ſoul</hi> being imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately united to the <hi>Deity,</hi> Chriſt from the very moment of his conception had the ſight of God. Now for our Saviour, who had known experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally how <hi>ſweet</hi> the comfort of his Fathers face had been, and had lived all his days under the <hi>warm beams</hi> and <hi>influences</hi> of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> and had had his ſoul all along refreſhed with the ſenſe of the Divine preſence, for him to be left in that <hi>horror</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> as to have no taſte of comfort, no <hi>glimpſe</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi> breaking in upon his humane ſoul, how great an affliction muſt that needs be unto him? This ſpiritual <hi>dereliction</hi> (as was formerly hinted) which our Saviour under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went, was part of the puniſhment due to us for our ſins. When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, he was driven out of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> he was baniſhed out of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, man <hi>forſaking</hi> God, God <hi>forſook</hi> him, and <hi>withdrew</hi> himſelf from him: now that <hi>dereliction</hi> which we deſerved in <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt ſuffered for us. Hence is that of <hi>Cyril: When</hi> Adam <hi>had tranſgreſſed the Divine commandment, humane nature was forſaken of God, and made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject unto the curſe and to death. Now theſe words of our Saviour, when he crys out, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? are the words of Chriſt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly diſcharging or paying that debt of dereliction that was come upon us by means of ſin, and pacifying God this way.</hi> Hence alſo is that expreſſion of another of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">Deſeritur cum deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt was deſerted with them who were deſerted, and Chriſt paid the tribute for that nature which he had aſſumed;</hi> that is, Chriſt
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:99997:164"/>paid our <hi>debt,</hi> Chriſt was forſaken with us who were forſaken, that ſo Divine grace and favour might return again to us; the face of God was <hi>hid</hi> from him <hi>for a time,</hi> that ſo it might not be <hi>hid</hi> from us <hi>for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if it be asked, But what was this dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? I ſhall</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Shew <hi>negatively</hi> what it was not; and</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitively</hi> and <hi>affirmatively</hi> what it was.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What it was not. It was not a diſſolution of the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>two Natures.</hi> The <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>two Natures</hi> in Chriſt continued notwithſtanding this his <hi>dereliction;</hi> for if the perſonal Union of the two Natures had been diſſolved, if it had not continued in the time of the <hi>ſufferings</hi> of Chriſt, then it would have followed, that it was not <hi>God</hi> that was the <hi>Perſon</hi> that ſuffered, and ſo the <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of Chriſts ſufferings would have been enervated, and taken away; but the Scriptures tell us, That it was <hi>God that redeemed the Church with his own blood, Act.</hi> 20.28. the <hi>Perſon ſuffering</hi> was <hi>God,</hi> though it was in <hi>our nature</hi> that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Alſo they tell us, That <hi>they crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. the <hi>Perſon ſuffering</hi> was God, although it was in and by the <hi>fleſh</hi> that he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. <hi>I am the bread that came down from heaven, if any man eat of this bread he ſhall live for ever, and the bread which I ſhall give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> which is given for the life of the world, it is the fleſh of the <hi>Word,</hi> the fleſh of the <hi>ſecond Perſon</hi> in <hi>Trinity, The Word was made fleſh, Joh.</hi> 1.14. that perſon who is called the <hi>Word,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, who <hi>came down from heaven</hi> by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and took fleſh, <hi>gave that fleſh for the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:99997:164"/>life of the world.</hi> The <hi>Word</hi> is the Perſon who takes fleſh; the <hi>Word,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, who takes a part of our <hi>fleſh,</hi> is not disjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſunited from his fleſh all the time of his ſufferings, it is <hi>his fleſh</hi> ſtill, <hi>The bread which I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> The <hi>Word,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, accounts it <hi>his fleſh,</hi> whilſt he ſuffers, it was the <hi>fleſh</hi> only that was capable of ſuffering; but the <hi>Word,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, ſtood re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to that fleſh in the time of his ſuffering, yea he was <hi>one</hi> with it in the bond of perſonal Union; therefore it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for us in the fleſh.</hi> It is a remarkable expreſſion, <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for us in the fleſh,</hi> the perſon ſuffering is Chriſt, the Son of God, though it was in the <hi>fleſh,</hi> in the Humanity, that he ſuffered: the <hi>humane nature</hi> is only capable of ſuffering; but yet the perſon of the Son of God was united to that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> in the time when he ſuffered, there was no diſſolution of the union of the two natures.

                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>dereliction</hi> or <hi>deſertion</hi> of our Saviour was not a deſertion in point of grace. Chriſt had all along the ſame preſence of <hi>Divine grace</hi> with him, to carry him out to all acts of <hi>obedience.</hi> There was no <hi>failure</hi> as to any one act of <hi>obedience</hi> in Chriſt. If Chriſt had been deſerted in point of grace, and any one act of obedience had been interrupted, then his obedience had not been perfect and compleat; and if his obedience had not been perfect and compleat, it had not been ſuch an obedience as the Law requires and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts;
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:99997:165"/>for the Law accepts of nothing but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience, and that conſummate to the end of a mans life: <hi>Curſed is he that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> There muſt not be the doing of <hi>ſome things</hi> only which the Law requires, but there muſt be the doing of <hi>all things,</hi> and that to the <hi>end</hi> of a mans life, if a man gives that obedience which the Law will accept; and therefore we muſt ſuppoſe, that there was not the leaſt <hi>interruption</hi> in any one act of obedience in our Saviour, no, he was <hi>obedient unto the death,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He was obedient unto the death, even the death of the croſs:</hi> his obedience ran throughout his <hi>whole life,</hi> and it extended it ſelf to the very end and laſt period of his life, <hi>He was obedient unto the death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was not <hi>deſertion</hi> in point of <hi>ſupport,</hi> Chriſt was not ſo deſerted in his ſufferings, as not to be ſupported under them. Hence is that of one of the Ancients:

                     <hi>Chriſt was forſaken, not in reſpect of miſery as to himſelf, but out of mercy towards us; Chriſt was forſaken, not by the loſs of Divine help, but in his being left to dye, unto which he was determined by the forcknowledge of God.</hi> Chriſt had <hi>ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in his ſufferings, otherwiſe he had <hi>ſunk</hi> under them. It is true, our Saviour was not ſo ſenſible of that ſupport which he had: many of the Saints are <hi>ſupported</hi> under great <hi>tryals,</hi> ſore <hi>afflictions,</hi> and <hi>temptations</hi> that they meet with, and yet they are not always ſo ſenſible of that ſupport that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to them. So was it with our Saviour, he had <hi>ſupport,</hi> and yet he was not ſo <hi>ſenſible</hi> of his ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and therefore is it that he complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
                     <pb n="313" facs="tcp:99997:165"/>and mark what follows, <hi>Why art thou ſo far from helping me?</hi> He was holpen of God, but yet he had <hi>little ſenſe</hi> of help, the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of ſupport was much taken from him, <hi>Why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring? I cry in the day time, and thou heareſt not.</hi> Though our Saviour had indeed ſupport, yet he complains as one that had no ſenſe and feeling of it: there may be <hi>ſupport</hi> under great <hi>tryals</hi> and <hi>afflictions,</hi> and yet there may be little <hi>feeling</hi> of that ſupport; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it, that ſome of the Saints have complained of being overwhelmed. Conſider the title of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. <hi>A prayer of the afflicted when he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed,</hi> the Saints may be <hi>overwhelmed.</hi> Then is a perſon ſaid to be overwhelmed, when he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>great ſorrows</hi> and ſufferings, and hath little or no <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>ſupport</hi> given in to him. Thus hath it been with the Saints, and thus was it with the Head of the Saints the Lord Jeſus, he had ſupport, but yet he had little <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>ſupport;</hi> the ſupport he had for it was the Divinity that <hi>ſtrengthened</hi> and <hi>corroborated</hi> him to bear all his ſufferings; therefore is it ſaid, That <hi>by the eternal Spirit he offered himſelf without ſpot to God, Heb.</hi> 9.14. It was by the <hi>power</hi> of the Deity, that he was corroborated to ſuffer what he did ſuffer, and yet he complains of the want of the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in the place formerly mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have ſeen what this <hi>dereliction</hi> was not. It was not a <hi>diſſolution</hi> of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of the <hi>two Natures,</hi> not a <hi>deſertion</hi> in point of <hi>grace,</hi> not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion</hi> in point of <hi>ſupport.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What then was it?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, It was <hi>deſertion</hi> in point of <hi>comfort, dereliction</hi> in point of <hi>manifeſtation.</hi>

                  <p>To underſtand this we muſt know, That in the death of Chriſts <hi>body,</hi> when his body dyed, the ſoul was ſeparated from the body, but how? not <hi>perſonally,</hi>

Divines</hi> have an apt ſimilitude to illuſtrate this: A man that hath his ſword in his ſcabbard, holds it in his hand for a time, then draws his ſword out of his ſcabbard, the <hi>ſword</hi> and the <hi>ſheath</hi> are ſeparated one from the other, but neither is ſeparated from the man, the man holds both in his hands. In like manner in the <hi>death</hi> of Chriſt, Chriſts <hi>humane</hi> ſoul was ſeparated from his body, but neither was ſeparated from the Divinity, the Divinity <hi>held</hi> both: ſo that in the death of Chriſts <hi>body,</hi> the ſoul was ſeparated from the body not <hi>perſonally,</hi> but in reſpect of place. So in this of his <hi>dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> which was as it were the <hi>ſupernatural death</hi> of his ſoul, the Deity was <hi>ſeparated</hi> from Chriſts ſoul, but how? not <hi>perſonally,</hi> the <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> remained ſtill; how then was it ſeparated? only in reſpect of <hi>operation;</hi> there was not that opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Divinity</hi> in the humane ſoul of our Saviour in a way of <hi>comfort,</hi> in a way of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation as before, the <hi>ſeparation</hi> was in point of <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>manifeſtation,</hi>

<pb n="315" facs="tcp:99997:166"/>of our ſins.</hi> This then was that dereliction that our Saviour underwent, the <hi>beams</hi> of the Divinity contained themſelves as it were from <hi>ſhining</hi> forth upon the humane ſoul of our Saviour, the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity that was wont to ſhine upon his humane ſoul before, <hi>withdrew</hi> its rays. The Ancients and ſome other modern Learned men have many elegant expreſſions to ſet forth this <hi>dereliction</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Some of the Ancients call the ſufferings of Chriſt, the <hi>Sleep</hi> as it were of the <hi>Divinity;</hi> had the <hi>Divinity</hi> or <hi>Godhead</hi> exerted it ſelf in Chriſt, as it might have done, it could eaſily have prevented all ſuffering and death; therefore the Divinity <hi>ſuſpending</hi> its operations, is ſaid by the Ancients to <hi>ſleep</hi> and <hi>reſt</hi> as it were, that ſo the <hi>humane nature</hi> might be capable of ſuffering.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:99997:167"/>the ſight of God; Chriſt, as he was man, had God for his <hi>God,</hi> and for him to be deprived of the ſight of the face of <hi>his God,</hi> this muſt needs be the greateſt affliction to him; therefore doth he cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> The happineſs of Chriſt, as he was man, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in the ſight of the <hi>face</hi> of his God; and therefore for him to be deprived of the ſight of this <hi>face,</hi> muſt needs be the greateſt affliction to him. This <hi>ſubduction</hi> or <hi>withdrawing</hi> of the <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in point of <hi>manifeſtation,</hi> the <hi>hiding</hi> of the face of God from Chriſt, muſt needs be the <hi>greateſt affliction</hi> to him upon theſe two conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe our Saviour had been <hi>inured</hi> and <hi>accuſtomed</hi> to the <hi>ſight</hi> of God, and knew what the happineſs of it was. Our Saviour had walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the light of his Fathers <hi>countenance</hi> all his days until now; therefore is it that he ſaith in one place, That <hi>the Father was with him,</hi> and in another place, That <hi>the Father had not left him alone,</hi> and elſewhere he ſaith, That <hi>he had ſeen the Father.</hi> It is the common opinion of <hi>Divines,</hi> That Chriſt had the ſight of God from the firſt moment of his conception. Now for him that had once taſted of the <hi>light</hi> of Gods <hi>countenance,</hi> to loſe it, this muſt needs be the <hi>greateſt</hi> and moſt <hi>bitter</hi> affliction to him. The <hi>greateſt miſery</hi> we ſay is, for a perſon once to have been happy, and then to loſe his happineſs. It is not ſo much for a man that never knew what the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and comfort of Gods love meant, to be without it, as it is for another perſon that hath been raviſhed with the <hi>ſuavity</hi> and <hi>delights</hi> of Gods love, to be deprived of them. Now this was our Saviours caſe, our Saviour had taſted of the ſweetneſs of
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:99997:167"/>his Fathers love, he knew what <hi>happineſs</hi> was in the <hi>beatifical Viſion,</hi> and now for him to come to be deprived of it, O how great an affliction muſt this needs be! This conſideration may well put us upon this contemplation, whether the <hi>ſorrows</hi> and <hi>ſufferings</hi> of our Saviour in this reſpect did not exceed thoſe of the damned. The damned in Hell indeed want the <hi>beatifical Viſion,</hi> they have not the <hi>ſight</hi> of God for the preſent, neither are they ever like to have it, O but they never had <hi>experience</hi> what the <hi>ſweetneſs</hi> and <hi>happineſs</hi> of the injoyment of God was. It is true, the <hi>damned</hi> ſhall have their faculties much more inlarged than now they have, to apprehend what a loſs they do ſuſtain, in being deprived of ſuch an infinite good as God is, they will have greater apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at laſt how great a loſs the loſs of an <hi>infinite good</hi> is; but they never had an <hi>experimental ſenſe</hi> and <hi>taſte</hi> what the ſweetneſs and happineſs is that is to be found in God. But now our Saviour had this <hi>experimental taſte</hi> of the <hi>ſweetneſs, delight, joy, ſatisfaction</hi> that the ſight of God could afford to his humane ſoul; and therefore for him to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it, his ſorrows in this reſpect ſeem to exceed the ſorrows of the damned. The damned may bewail an infinite good that they have loſt, though they know not what he is, nor have any experimental taſte of his ſweetneſs; but now Chriſt knew what the <hi>excellency</hi> of God was, and had the moſt <hi>familiar acquaintance</hi> with him, and yet was ſeparated from all that ſweetneſs for a time, which he had ſo lively a taſte of before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This <hi>deſertion</hi> of our Saviour muſt needs be the higheſt affliction to him of all others, becauſe the <hi>humane ſoul</hi> of Chriſt had the <hi>cleareſt ſight</hi> of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:99997:168"/>God that ever any creature had. The <hi>humane ſoul</hi> of Chriſt, by means of the <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> was brought nearer to the <hi>Deity</hi> than ever any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>man</hi> or <hi>Angel</hi> was brought unto: look there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the <hi>habitual</hi> grace that is in the humane nature of Chriſt, by means of the <hi>perſonal</hi> Union, which is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of it, doth far excel, as to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and degree, all that grace that is found either in men or Angels: ſo for the ſame reaſon we muſt ſuppoſe, that Chriſt, as <hi>he was man,</hi> by virtue of the <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> had a clearer ſight of God than ever any creature had. Now then for him that had ſo <hi>clear</hi> a <hi>ſight</hi> of the Divinity; that he who had his faculties inlarged to the uttermoſt to contemplate the excellency and perfection of the <hi>Deity,</hi> ſhould all of a ſudden loſe this ſight; that all of a ſudden the <hi>glorious light</hi> that had ſhone upon his ſoul all his life time before, ſhould be withdrawn, and that he ſhould be left in perfect darkneſs, what a change muſt this needs be? This was that which made him utter thoſe words with ſo much bitterneſs, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> how he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them is moſt obſervable:

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:99997:168"/>the ſorrows of our Saviour be, that forced him to ſuch an out-cry as this is, that the <hi>ſtanders-by</hi> muſt take notice of it? We read of many of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs that bare their ſufferings without any ſuch ſenſible <hi>commotion,</hi> we read of no ſuch out crys from them, when they were in the midſt of the <hi>flames.</hi> Now our Saviour had his heart fortified and ſtrengthened with far more Grace than any of them, God gave him grace not by <hi>meaſure,</hi> he had grace conferred upon his Humanity in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree that a created nature was capable of. How inexpreſſible then muſt the ſorrows of Chriſt be, and how far did they exceed the ſorrows of all others, that he ſhould make ſuch an out-cry as this is! the reaſon of which was, That he did not only feel the <hi>wonted preſence</hi> of his Father with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from him, but he ſaw God <hi>alienated</hi> from him, yea he ſaw his <hi>Juſtice</hi> armed againſt him to revenge upon him the ſins of the Elect.

It is true, <hi>wicked</hi> men <hi>love</hi> not God, and <hi>care</hi> not for his <hi>preſence,</hi> and therefore they think it will be no great loſs for them to be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from him whom they do not <hi>love.</hi> But when wicked men ſhall come to underſtand, that there is no happineſs but in the injoyment of God, and that the laſt perfection that their Being was capable of, was to injoy him; though they love not God, yet they love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; though they love not God, yet they love happineſs: therefore though they think it a <hi>little thing</hi> to be ſeparated from God now, they will not think it a <hi>little thing</hi> to be ſeparated from <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> at laſt: <hi>With thee,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>is the fountain of life, and in thy light we ſhall ſee light, Pſal.</hi> 36.9.

That which <hi>Divines</hi> call the <hi>Pain</hi> of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> is a moſt <hi>perfect ſenſe</hi> of the wrath of God, and all the <hi>miſeries</hi> that do attend it; it doth, I ſay,

Now our Saviour, in being <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us, had this perfect ſenſe of Gods wrath, and felt thoſe miſeries that do attend it, as we ſhall ſhew more by and by. That Chriſt was <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us the Scripture is clear, the Apoſtle tells us expreſly in that known Text, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. That <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> Sin was the <hi>inlet</hi> of the Curſe, and the <hi>Curſe</hi> was the <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of ſin. When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, the Lord ſaith to him, <hi>Curſed is the ground for thy ſake, Gen.</hi> 3.17. Now if the <hi>ground</hi> be <hi>accurſed</hi> for <hi>Adams</hi> ſake, <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf muſt needs be much more accurſed;
<note place="margin">Quod efficit tale, eſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis tale.</note> for that which makes any other thing to be what it is, is much more ſo in it ſelf. If therefore <hi>Adam</hi> be the cauſe why the ground is curſed, <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf muſt needs be much more
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:99997:171"/>
                     <hi>accurſed.</hi> This is more fully explained in that <hi>ſentence</hi> of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.26. <hi>Carſed be he that confirmeth not all the words of the Law to do them.</hi> Every <hi>tranſgreſſor</hi> of the Law is curſed by the Law. Therefore if Chriſt will redeem us from the curſe of the Law, he muſt of neceſſity take upon him the curſe of the Law for us. In open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Head, this part of the Doctrine of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> there are three things that are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be ſpoken unto.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To ſhew what the notion of the <hi>Curſe</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew how it was that Chriſt was <hi>made</hi> a curſe for us.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſhew how this could be ſo, how it was poſſible for Chriſt to be made a curſe for us, how it could be, that he that was moſt <hi>bleſſed</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhould yet be made a curſe for us.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing we are to ſpeak to is, To ſhew what the notion of the Curſe doth imply.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Curſe implies <hi>diſplicency</hi> or diſpleaſure in him that pronounceth it. No man <hi>curſeth</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother but he conceiveth <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> and <hi>indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> againſt him whom he ſo curſeth, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>He that withholdeth corn, the people ſhall curſe him.</hi> The meaning is, he that keeps in his corn, which is a <hi>common benefit,</hi> in a time of <hi>common neceſſuy,</hi> the people will <hi>curſe</hi> him, that is, their hearts will riſe in anger and indignation againſt him. There will be a common grudge againſt ſuch a perſon: the Curſe beſpeaks diſpleaſure in him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Curſe implies <hi>utmoſt</hi> diſpleaſure and <hi>abhorrence</hi> in him that utters it. The Curſe doth not imply diſpleaſure in general, or ſome ſmall
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:99997:171"/>diſpleaſure, but it implies the utmoſt <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> and <hi>abhorrence:</hi> the <hi>Curſe</hi> is a ſign of <hi>loathing</hi> and <hi>deteſtation.</hi> Perſons are not wont to break forth into curſes till their anger and indignation be boiled up to a height: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.21. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs, that when they ſhall be hungry, they ſhall fret themſelves, and curſe their King and their God.</hi> Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing doth uſually proceed from <hi>rage,</hi> when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hates another, and is inraged againſt him, this is that makes him break forth into curſing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Curſe notes the <hi>imprecation</hi> or praying down of evil upon another. The Curſe is the <hi>imprecating all manner of evils upon another:</hi> Prov.
<note place="margin">Maledictio eſt impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio malo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 26.2. <hi>The curſe cauſleſs ſhall not come.</hi> The Curſe in this place notes the imprecating or praying down of evil upon another. He that prays that ſuch and ſuch evils may come upon another; if he hath no ground nor warrant for his prayer, ſuch a curſe ſhall do no harm. The <hi>School men</hi> deſcribe a curſe to be, <hi>When any one out of anger or hatred imprecates or prays down ſome evil upon a perſon, not for the good of the perſon, but for his hurt, and out of a deſire of revenge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Curſe implies <hi>actual inflicting</hi> of <hi>evil</hi> upon another, ſo far as it lies in a mans power. In a <hi>curſe</hi> there is a ſecret <hi>appetite</hi> of <hi>revenge:</hi> now he that deſires <hi>revenge</hi> upon another, would do him all the miſchief that lies in his power. This we may ſee plainly in <hi>Shimei</hi>'s curſing of <hi>David,</hi> it is ſaid of <hi>Shimei, That he curſed David, and threw ſtones at him, and caſt duſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.13. It was not in his power to reach <hi>David</hi> at that time, and do him a miſchief, but it was in his heart to do it. It is in the nature of a curſe for a man to do a perſon whom he <hi>curſes,</hi> all the miſchief that he can.</p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:99997:172"/>
                  <p n="5">5. The Curſe doth ſometimes ſignifie the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and <hi>extermination</hi> of the thing curſed, the curſe brings <hi>deſtruction</hi> with it. When our Saviour <hi>curſed</hi> the <hi>barren fig-tree,</hi> the fig-tree did immediately wither; therefore are the <hi>curſe</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> joyned together, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.19. <hi>That thou ſhouldſt become a deſolation, and a curſe.</hi> And it is a full place to explain this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.20. <hi>The Lord ſhall ſend upon thee curſing, vexation, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, until thou be deſtroyed, and thou ſhalt periſh quickly.</hi> So that the Curſe brings periſhings and deſtruction with it: this is the notion of the <hi>Curſe</hi> in general. Now by nature we are all <hi>under</hi> the Curſe, and it is proper for us to conſider how it is that we are ſaid to be under the Curſe, becauſe Chriſt was <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us, to <hi>deliver</hi> us that were <hi>under the curſe.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That as many as are of the works of the Law are under the curſe, Gal.</hi> 3.10. What doth this imply? How is it that we are under the Curſe? There are theſe things implied in it proportionable to what we have heard.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God hath conceived <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> againſt us by reaſon of ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.11. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day.</hi> Every man, whilſt he is in the ſtate of nature, is in Gods account a <hi>wicked man.</hi> Though there are <hi>degrees</hi> of ſin, yet every perſon is ſo far a wicked man in Gods account, that God is angry with him. <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day:</hi> that is, God is angry with ſinners, as they are ſinners; therefore is it ſaid, That <hi>by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are the children of wrath, Eph.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are ſaid to be <hi>under the Curſe</hi> in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, That God is not only a <hi>little diſpleaſed</hi> at us, but in that he is <hi>highly diſpleaſed</hi> with us by reaſon
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:99997:172"/>of ſin, the Curſe denotes <hi>utmoſt diſpleaſure</hi> and <hi>abhorrence. The wrath of God is revealed from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven againſt all the ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men, Rom.</hi> 1.18. God proclaims it to all the world, that he is highly offended with ſinners. The <hi>indignation</hi> which God hath againſt men by reaſon of ſin (to ſpeak after the manner of men) is that which <hi>provokes</hi> him to curſe them. When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, what did the Lord ſay to him? See how high his diſpleaſure riſeth againſt him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou haſt hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and haſt eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee that thou ſhouldeſt not eat of it.</hi> Here is a plain <hi>indication</hi> of anger. It is as much as if God had ſaid, Thou haſt tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed my <hi>command,</hi> my <hi>plain command,</hi> what follows? <hi>Curſed be the ground for thy ſake:</hi> as much as if it had been ſaid, <hi>Curſed be thou, and curſed be the earth for thy ſake.</hi> Sin, I ſay (to ſpeak after the manner of men) provokes God to give forth the curſe upon men. Thus the Lord ſpake expreſly to <hi>Cain</hi> after he had <hi>murdered</hi> his brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.10. <hi>What haſt thou done? the voice of thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers blood crys to me from the ground, what haſt thou done?</hi> This is a ſpeech noting utmoſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and what follows upon this? <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>thou art curſed from the earth:</hi> thou haſt done that which is <hi>moſt diſpleaſing</hi> unto me, and now thou art <hi>curſed</hi> from the earth, that is, I will withdraw all influences of my love and favour from thee, thou ſhalt not have the leaſt place in my love, but thou art a <hi>curſed perſon,</hi> one remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under my utmoſt diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are under the Curſe, that is, we are under the <hi>denunciation of evil.</hi> God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:99997:173"/>evil concerning us. When <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, <hi>part</hi> of the Curſe was this, <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto duſt thou ſhalt return, Gen.</hi> 3.9. Here is a <hi>preſent denunciation</hi> of evil upon ſin, and the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſentence</hi> of the Law is, <hi>The ſoul that ſins ſhall dye.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are under the <hi>Curſe,</hi> in as much as many <hi>penal evils</hi> are already inflicted upon us as <hi>part</hi> of the Curſe, and <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> that is due to us by reaſon of ſin. <hi>Sickneſs, pain, infirmity</hi> of the <hi>body, anguiſh, grief, ſorrow</hi> in the <hi>mind</hi> are part of the miſeries that we ſuffer in this life, and theſe things, <hi>materially</hi> conſidered, are part of the Curſe, for as much as if there had been no ſin, there had been none of theſe things. It was ſin that brought in <hi>ſickneſs, infirmity, pain, grief,</hi> and whatever miſeries men have experience of in this life, and theſe are <hi>part</hi> of the Curſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the happy ſtate of the <hi>New Jeruſalem</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by this, <hi>That there ſhall be no more curſe there, Rev.</hi> 22.3. When ſin ſhall be removed, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſin, all thoſe miſeries which ſin hath brought in, ſhall be removed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We are <hi>under the Curſe,</hi> that is, we are liable to <hi>deſtruction</hi> of ſoul and body in Hell for ever, as the juſt revenge which God executes upon us by reaſon of ſin; this is in the nature of the Curſe, that it brings <hi>deſtruction</hi> with it. So that when we are ſaid to be <hi>under the curſe,</hi> the meaning is, that we are liable to the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of ſoul and body in Hell for ever. The Curſe hath not <hi>ſpent</hi> it ſelf, it hath not <hi>exhauſted</hi> all its <hi>venom,</hi> till it hath brought the ſinner to the <hi>utmoſt degree</hi> of miſery that the ſinner is capable of. Therefore when our Saviour pronounceth the <hi>ſentenco</hi> of <hi>puniſhment</hi>
                     <pb n="329" facs="tcp:99997:173"/>upon the <hi>damned,</hi> he expreſſeth it thus: <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, Mat.</hi> 25.41. It is as much as if he had ſaid, You are <hi>curſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> the Curſe hath taken hold of you, the Curſe is come in its full power and ſtrength upon you, and there is none to deliver you from it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will the <hi>Curſe</hi> carry you into <hi>everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Nothing will ſatisfie the Curſe but the utmoſt <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the ſinner, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord.</hi> That which the <hi>Curſe</hi> aims at is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> Now wicked men are puniſhed with <hi>deſtruction</hi> from the preſence of the Lord, <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is brought upon them by the <hi>Curſe</hi> as the juſt puniſhment of their ſin. Though wicked men have a <hi>being</hi> ſtill in Hell, yet their <hi>well being</hi> is taken away, the <hi>Curſe</hi> takes away their <hi>well being,</hi> and brings them to the <hi>utmoſt degree</hi> of miſery that they are capable of.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing we have to ſpeak unto is, How it was that Chriſt was <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3.10. This I ſhall endeavour to open in ſome Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt was <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us, in that the <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of God and his <hi>indignation</hi> againſt us for ſin was poured forth upon Chriſt to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> began to conflict with the ſenſe of Gods wrath in his Agony in the Garden, there he ſaw the wrath of God approaching to him: But now in his ſufferings upon the Croſs, there it was that he bare the <hi>Curſe</hi> fully, there was the wrath of God fully poured out upon him. The <hi>Curſe</hi> ſpeaks <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> as we
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:99997:174"/>have heard; if therefore Chriſt be <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us, as the Scripture affirms <hi>plainly</hi> that he was, then of neceſſity it follows, that he muſt bear Gods wrath and anger in ſome ſort or other for us.
<note place="margin">

That is ſaid to be curſed of God, which God loaths and hates. Iſa.</hi> 53.3. it is ſaid there, That Chriſt <hi>was deſpiſed and rejected of men. He was cut off from the land of the living,</hi> as a perſon not fit to <hi>live,</hi> that was a ſign that he was <hi>accurſt</hi> of men. But that is not all, Chriſt was not only <hi>accurſt</hi> of men, but in ſome ſenſe he was accurſt before God himſelf. For in that Text in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> which I ſhall touch upon hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>he that hangs upon a tree</hi> was accounted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed by God himſelf: So that Chriſt was not only accurſt before men, but in ſome reſpects he was ſaid to be accurſt of God himſelf. Chriſt was <hi>accurſt</hi> of God, not in reſpect of himſelf (as I ſhall ſhew more hereafter, when I come to ſhew you how this could be, that he that was <hi>moſt bleſſed</hi> could be <hi>made a curſe</hi>) but in reſpect of us, whoſe ſins he bare. Yet Chriſt in reſpect of us the guilt of whoſe ſins he bare, was <hi>accurſt</hi> of God. The Apoſtle tells us, that Chriſt was made a curſe, <hi>Who hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us, Gal.</hi> 3.10. If Chriſt were made a curſe, of whom, or by whom was it that he was made a curſe? Of his Father certainly. He that made him ſin for us, made him alſo a curſe for us. Now who was it made him ſin for us? That was God himſelf; ſo the Apoſtle tell us,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:99997:174"/>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us.</hi> He that might be made <hi>ſin</hi> for us, might be made a <hi>curſe</hi> for us. Chriſt was made ſin, therefore he was made a curſe; and it was God that made him ſin, therefore God that made him a curſe. If Chriſt then were made a curſe by God himſelf for us, then he was not only accurſed before men, and in the ſight of men; but as he was our <hi>Surety,</hi> and as he bare the guilt of our ſins (though he were an innocent perſon in himſelf, and as conſidered in himſelf always beloved of God) he was accurſed by him by whom he was made a curſe. That which alſo confirms this, is this conſideration, That Chriſt was made a curſe for us, as undergoing that puniſhment the Law exacted, ſo the Apoſtle teaches us, <hi>He hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> If therefore Chriſt be made a curſe in conformity to the Law, he muſt ſuſtain that <hi>Curſe</hi> that the Law threatens and will inflict. Now this is certain, that the <hi>wrath</hi> of God is comprehended in the curſe of the Law; for what is the curſe of the Law? The curſe of the Law is this, <hi>Indignation and wrath, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation and anguiſh upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9. Therefore if Chriſt bare the curſe of the Law, he muſt of neceſſity bear the ſenſe of Gods wrath in his ſoul for us. Neither let us wonder at this, That Chriſt, as to his own ſenſe and apprehenſion, ſhould be as a perſon <hi>loathed</hi> and <hi>abhorred</hi> of God for our ſakes, who was always <hi>beloved</hi> of God in himſelf; but let us rather wonder at the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of our <hi>ſins,</hi> that he that was ſo dear to God in himſelf, ſhould yet be made the object of his wrath and indignation, and be dealt withal, as if he were a perſon hated
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:99997:175"/>of God meerly to <hi>expiate</hi> the guilt of our ſins. It is an elegant expreſſion which a Learned man hath:
<note place="margin">Quid mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ſi ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictus dicitur Deo, qui habet in ſe quod odit Deus, hoc eſt pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum?</note> 
                     <hi>What wonder is it that he ſhould be accounted accurſed of God that hath that upon him, which God hates that is ſin?</hi> Chriſt was looked upon by God as ſtanding guilty of our ſins in a way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us.</hi> How <hi>made</hi> him to be <hi>ſin?</hi> In a way of imputation. Chriſt had no ſin of his own, but he was made ſin by way of imputation. Therefore Chriſt ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>perſon</hi> of a <hi>Sinner,</hi> although he had no ſin of his own, he is <hi>accurſt</hi> of God, the <hi>wrath</hi> of God breaks forth upon him. Neither was it a <hi>little wrath</hi> that was let forth upon Chriſt, but there was a whole <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Deluge</hi> of wrath let forth upon Chriſt; ſo much <hi>wrath</hi> as the humane nature was capable of bearing, ſo much muſt we ſuppoſe was let in upon him; and the reaſon is, becauſe ſin deſerves the utmoſt <hi>degree</hi> of puniſhment that the nature of the creature is capable of; therefore muſt we ſuppoſe, that the wrath of God was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated</hi> in our Saviour. Whatever wrath the humane nature ſupported by the <hi>Divinity</hi> was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of bearing, all that we muſt ſuppoſe was poured out upon our Saviour. Hence is that expreſſion of the Prophet, <hi>I have trodden the wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs alone, and there was no one with me, Iſa.</hi> 63.3. Our Saviour in his <hi>Paſſion,</hi> in his <hi>Sufferings</hi> in the <hi>Garden</hi> and on the <hi>Croſs</hi> hath trodden the <hi>wine preſs</hi> of Divine wrath, the wrath of God was <hi>expreſt</hi> and <hi>poured forth</hi> upon him to the utmoſt. Now who knows, who can conceive what this means? Who knows what the <hi>power</hi> of Gods <hi>anger</hi> is? Who knows what that <hi>wrath</hi> is, that is let forth upon the ſpirits of the damned? <hi>Job</hi> complains in his
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:99997:175"/>afflictions, That <hi>God hunted him as a fierce lion,</hi> and <hi>that he did ſhew himſelf marvellous upon him, Job</hi> 14.16. Now if God might ſhew himſelf thus <hi>marvellous</hi> and <hi>terrible</hi> to his own children whom he doth love, how <hi>marvellous</hi> and <hi>terrible</hi> doth he ſhew himſelf to the damned whom he hates! Now Chriſt, <hi>our Surety,</hi> though he was always <hi>beloved</hi> of God as in <hi>himſelf,</hi> yet he bare the very <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> for us. Look therefore what <hi>wrath</hi> the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned feel, who lye under the <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>fierceneſs</hi> of Gods wrath, that muſt Chriſt feel who is our <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that we may be delivered from it. O let us conſider theſe things, and let them ſink deeply into our hearts: Let us conſider with our ſelves, in what wrath it is that God manifeſts himſelf to a damned ſoul; in the ſame wrath did God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf to Chriſt who was our <hi>Surety,</hi> that ſo we might be kept from <hi>damnation;</hi> for if Chriſt had not ſuffered the <hi>pains</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> for us, we muſt have been left to ſuffer them our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whatever <hi>ſhame,</hi> whatever <hi>ignominy</hi> and <hi>contempt,</hi> whatever <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>torment,</hi> whatever <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>grief</hi> either in his <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>body,</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſuffered and underwent upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> he ſaw plainly that it was the <hi>effect</hi> of the wrath of God, and the juſt <hi>puniſhment</hi> that was due to us for our ſins. The <hi>ſting</hi> of an affliction is, when a man ſuffers as a <hi>guilty perſon,</hi> when he ſeeth clearly, that what he ſuffers, he ſuffers it as an effect of Gods wrath, and as a juſt puniſhment of ſin from an <hi>angry God.</hi> A man might ſuffer great things as long as he ſeeth no mixture of wrath in all his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; but when he plainly ſeeth a <hi>vein</hi> of wrath from God in all his ſufferings, this is the ſting of all his ſufferings. Now our Saviour, though he was
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:99997:176"/>moſt innocent in himſelf, yet he ſeeth that the Juſtice of God proceeds againſt him as ſtanding under the guilt of our ſins; and whatever was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him, was nothing elſe but the <hi>effect</hi> of Divine wrath due to us. The death of Chriſt was a <hi>ſhameful</hi> death, and a <hi>painful</hi> death.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Crucifixion,</hi> or the <hi>death of the Croſs,</hi> was a <hi>ſhameful</hi> or <hi>ignominious</hi> death. Hence is that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>He endured the croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> The death of the Croſs had <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>ignominy</hi> attending of it. <hi>Crucifixion</hi> was ſuch a kind of puniſhment as was wont to be inflicted upon <hi>ſervants,</hi>

And the reaſon why <hi>Crucifixion</hi> or <hi>hanging upon a tree</hi> was accounted ſo infamous, was, becauſe he that was <hi>hung</hi> upon a <hi>tree,</hi> by being lifted up in that manner, was looked upon as an <hi>execrable perſon,</hi> as one that was not fit to live upon the earth, as one that was fit to be thruſt out of the world, turned out of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of mankind;

                        </gap>.</note> therefore is it, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens accounted this death an <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>filthy</hi> kind of death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Crucifixion</hi> was <hi>painful</hi> as well as <hi>ſhameful.</hi> To have ſeveral parts of the body thruſt through with nails, and faſtened to a tree, and hang there ſeveral hours together, this muſt needs be a <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> death. Now our Saviour ſuſtained all this, all this <hi>ſhame,</hi> all this <hi>pain,</hi> and that which was the venom of all, this he ſuſtained and underwent as the <hi>effect</hi> of Gods wrath, and the juſt <hi>puniſhment</hi> that was due to us for our ſins. So likewiſe he ſuſtained the greateſt <hi>ſorrows</hi> and <hi>dolors</hi> in his ſoul, as I have ſhewed at large heretofore. Our Saviour finding himſelf <hi>forſaken</hi> and <hi>deſerted</hi> of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:99997:176"/>God, finding God himſelf <hi>alienated</hi> from him, yea ſet againſt him to <hi>cut</hi> him <hi>off,</hi> this muſt needs fill his moſt holy Soul with the greateſt anguiſh and ſorrow: and yet all this, which he ſo underwent, the <hi>pain</hi> and <hi>ſhame,</hi> the anguiſh and ſorrow, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was he underwent in either kind, in his <hi>ſoul</hi> or <hi>body,</hi> he ſuffered it all as the <hi>fruit</hi> of Gods <hi>anger</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> againſt ſin, avenging <hi>our ſins</hi> upon him as our <hi>Surety.</hi> And that our Saviour ſaw all theſe things coming upon him, and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflicted upon him as the effect of Gods wrath, is plain by what the Apoſtle adds, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe for us; for it is written, Curſed is every one that hangs upon a tree.</hi> The Apoſtle proves his aſſertion, <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe for us,</hi> by this Topick or Argument; <hi>for it is written, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> Chriſt being crucified in that manner, being expoſed to that kind of ſuffering and death, it was a plain ſign and token that he was looked upon and dealt with as a perſon <hi>accurſed</hi> of God.

                     <hi>A perſon is not therefore accurſed, becauſe he hangs upon the tree; but he is therefore hanged upon the tree, becauſe he is accurſed.</hi> The Text from whence the Apoſtle takes this is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21.23. <hi>He that is hanged is curſed of God:</hi> ſo we render it, and ſo the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it, <hi>Curſed of God. Arius Montanus</hi> renders it, <hi>A perſon that is hanged is the curſe of God.</hi> He is the curſe of God, that is, the curſe of God is upon ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and becauſe the curſe of God is upon him, therefore doth he ſuffer that puniſhment. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe therefore renders it well: <hi>For as much as he hath ſinned againſt the Lord, therefore he is hanged upon the tree.</hi> Sin preceding, brings the curſe; and the curſe of God being upon ſuch a perſon, that kind of puniſhment was to be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our Saviour therefore being carried to the Croſs and crucified, ſaw plainly that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſins was laid upon him; our ſins were imputed to him as our Surety, and he being by this means led to the Croſs, ſaw plainly that he ſuffered the puniſhment that was due to us. The Croſs was a ſign and Symbol of Chriſts being made a <hi>curſe for us.</hi> And Learned men have this apprehenſion, that in this place in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> the Lord did before-hand, in his infinite Wiſdom, point out that kind of death <hi>hanging upon the tree,</hi> as an <hi>accurſed death,</hi> becauſe he intended that the death and ſufferings of Chriſt ſhould be ſignified thereby, and that Chriſt dying in this <hi>manner,</hi> his death ſhould be the <hi>expiatory Sacrifice</hi> to expiate and take away the Curſe that lay upon the whole world.</p>

                  <p>I Come to a third Particular, to ſhew you how it was that Chriſt was <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us.</p>
                  <p>The third Particular is this: In Chriſts being <hi>made a curſe,</hi> the <hi>wrath</hi> of God was <hi>conſummated</hi> upon him. Chriſt in being made a curſe for us, bare the <hi>whole</hi> puniſhment that was due to us. It was not part of the puniſhment only, but the whole puniſhment which was due to us that Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent. All the curſes of the Law did as it were meet upon him; and there was nothing wanting which the Law would inflict upon ſinners as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but the curſe brought upon Chriſt as our Surety. The curſe notes the <hi>utmoſt execution</hi> of <hi>evil</hi> upon the ſinner. It is in the nature of the curſe to <hi>imprecate</hi> the <hi>greateſt</hi> evil upon a perſon, and to <hi>bring</hi> the <hi>utmoſt</hi> evil upon him that it can. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt being made a curſe for us, he bare <hi>all</hi> the puniſhment that the Law could inflict.

                     <hi>Chriſts being made a curſe,</hi> ſays a Learned man, <hi>contains in it all our puniſhment.</hi> Whatever puniſhment was due to us was contained in this, That Chriſt was made a curſe. And another Judicious Divine hath a paſſage to this purpoſe: <hi>In Chriſts being made a curſe, the fulneſs of Gods wrath, and the dregs of that horrible cup was wholly poured out upon that
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:99997:179"/>ſacred head of his, when together and at once, Heaven and Earth and Hell ſeemed to conſpire together to exact from our Surety that puniſhment that was due to our ſins in that curſed kind of death, which was a ſign or Symbol of the Divine curſe that lay upon him.</hi> The <hi>whole puniſhment</hi> that was due to us for our ſins, was laid upon Chriſt in his being <hi>made a curſe.</hi> Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6, 10. <hi>The Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all:</hi> or as it is in the Margent, <hi>He hath made the iniquity of us all to meet upon him.</hi> The ſins of all the Elect did <hi>meet</hi> on Chriſt, that is, God did <hi>charge</hi> all the ſins of the Elect upon Chriſt; Chriſt was <hi>reckoned</hi> a ſinner by <hi>imputation,</hi> as it is in the laſt verſe of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>He was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and he bare the ſins of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ny. He was numbred with the tranſgreſſors.</hi> Chriſt, though he was no ſinner in himſelf, yet he was reckoned a ſinner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>He made him to be ſin that knew no ſin.</hi> Now as all the ſins of the Elect were charged upon Chriſt in a way of imputation, ſo the puniſhment of their ſins was laid upon him. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him, Iſa.</hi> 53.3. that is, <hi>the whole puniſhment due to us</hi> was laid upon Chriſt, and this is called <hi>the chaſtiſement of our peace,</hi> becauſe Chriſts undergoing of this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was that which was neceſſary to make our peace; the Juſtice of God required ſatisfaction, and unleſs the puniſhment which the Law threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens were ſome way born and undergone, God would not be at peace with us; therefore ſaith the Prophet, <hi>The chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him,</hi> that is, the puniſhment that was due to us was inflicted and laid upon our Surety, that ſo we that were at variance with God before, might
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:99997:180"/>now be brought into peace with him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it follows in the ſame place, <hi>By his ſtripes we are healed; the chaſtiſement of our people was upon him, and by his ſtripes we are healed.</hi> Chriſt bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which we ſhould have born, he undergo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our puniſhment, this is the means to make our peace with God. Hence alſo is that expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree.</hi> Chriſt our Surety bare all our ſins, he hath born the guilt and puniſhment of all the ſins of the Elect, and that wholly and fully: whatever the Law and Divine Juſtice would inflict upon us as ſinners, that Chriſt our Surety hath born for us. Hence is it that our Saviour immediately before his death, uttered theſe words, <hi>It is finiſhed, Joh.</hi> 19.30. It is <hi>finiſhed,

Chriſt did not make an end of his ſufferings until he had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all that he was to ſuffer. <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> that is, as another expounds that expreſſion, <hi>Chriſt fulfilled all the Scripture-prophecies, the ſubſt ance of the Types were fulfilled in him, and he fulfilled all that which God determined to be paid for the expiation of ſin.</hi> Chriſt finiſhed the whole work of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he left nothing <hi>undone</hi> and <hi>unſuffered</hi> that was to be done and ſuffered in order to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of our Salvation. <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> as much as if it had been ſaid, Nothing remains more to be ſuffered but the very act of dying, and giving up his life, which he was now juſt about to do, all that the Law and Juſtice could inflict upon him was inflicted upon him, and therefore he ſaid, <hi>It was finiſhed.</hi> Hence are thoſe expreſſions we have
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:99997:180"/>in the Book of <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 9.24. <hi>Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſin, and to make reconciliation for iniquity.</hi> Conſider thoſe expreſſions, <hi>to make an end of ſin,</hi> and <hi>to make reconciliation for iniquity.</hi> That expreſſion which we tranſlate <hi>to make an end of ſin,</hi> it is in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginai <hi>to ſeal up ſin:</hi> Chriſt hath ſealed up ſin in reſpect of the guilt of it as to condemnation. Chriſt by his death hath ſo ſealed up ſin, that ſin hath no more power to condemn thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, he hath perfectly taken away the condemning power of it. Hence is it ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt hath raſed out the hand-writing of ordinances that was againſt us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his croſs, Col.</hi> 2.14. and he is <hi>the Lamb of God that takes away the ſin of the world, Joh.</hi> 1.29. that is, he hath perfectly taken away ſin as to the guilt and condemnation of it. Now this could not have been, if Chriſt had not ſuffered all that was to be ſuffered, he could not have <hi>made an end of ſin,</hi> he could not have taken away the condemning power of it, if all the puniſhment that was to be inflicted upon the ſinner, had not been inflicted upon him; but now Chriſt by offering himſelf a Sacrifice for our ſins, hath born the whole puniſhment, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more remains to be ſuffered that Divine Juſtice can demand. This is implied in his being <hi>made a curſe,</hi> namely that the wrath of God was ſpent upon Chriſt to the utmoſt, and that Divine Juſtice could deſire no more than what was laid upon him.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Particular to clear this, how Chriſt was <hi>made a curſe,</hi> is this: The curſe took hold on
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:99997:181"/>Chriſt ſo far, as that Chriſt was exterminated and cut off by it. The utmoſt puniſhment that can be inflicted upon a Malefactor amongſt men is death, the extermination of him from mankind, cutting him off from the land of the living, ſeparating him from the ſociety of mankind. Now the curſe proceeded upon Chriſt ſo far, as that Chriſt was cut off by it. Hence are thoſe expreſſions of the Prophet, <hi>He was cut off from the land of the living, for the tranſgreſſion of my people was he ſmitten or ſtricken, Iſa.</hi> 53.8. So likewiſe we have the ſame expreſſion in the Book of <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſixty two weeks ſhall Meſſias be cut off, but not for himſelf.</hi> Chriſt, the true Meſſias, was to be cut off, but not <hi>for himſelf,</hi> that is, not for any ſin of his own, but he was cut off <hi>for us,</hi> becauſe he bare the guilt of our ſins. To underſtand this we muſt know, that nothing ſatisfies the Law but the death of the ſinner. We know what the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was that God pronounced upon our firſt Parents, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye the death:</hi> and this is the general ſentence of the Law, <hi>The ſoul that ſins ſhall dye;</hi> and, <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> Death is part of the curſe, yea death is as it were the conſummation of the curſe. Death, as it is the inlet unto eternal death, ſo it is the conſummation of the curſe. The curſe aims at the extermination and utter deſtruction of the ſinner. A man that is taken away by a corporal death, he is for ever deſtroyed as to men, though his ſoul ſurvive, yet he is taken from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men, he hath no communion with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Death is the deſtruction of a perſon as to any fellowſhip and communion that he is to have with mankind any longer in this world; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:99997:181"/>death is the utmoſt conſummation of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment amongſt men. Thus the curſe <hi>cuts off</hi> Chriſt, and Chriſt <hi>dyes</hi> as bearing the curſe; yea the curſe is conſummated in the death of Chriſt: Chriſt was <hi>accurſed</hi> even as <hi>Adam</hi> was. It is a good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of one of the Ancients: <hi>Chriſt deſcended as low as</hi> Adam <hi>did, and ſo diſſolved the curſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> Chriſt by deſcending where <hi>Adam</hi> had brought himſelf by his Fall, diſſolves the curſe that <hi>Adam</hi> had brought upon himſelf and his poſterity: the curſe that was upon <hi>Adam</hi> brought him to death, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return.</hi> The curſe lying upon <hi>Adam,</hi> ſubjected him to a ſtate of mortality, and brought him under the power of death. Chriſt therefore being <hi>made a curſe</hi> for us, the curſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects him to death, and takes away his life. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. That <hi>Chriſt taſted death for every man.</hi> Death is the <hi>completion</hi> of the curſe, becauſe the death of the body is the <hi>inlet</hi> to <hi>eternal death</hi> to thoſe who are ſtill under the power of the curſe. It is true, Chriſt did not taſte the <hi>pains</hi> of eternal death after his natural life was ended; but Chriſt taſted the pains of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural death before the taking away of his natural life, as I have ſhewed heretofore; and here we may obſerve this <hi>difference</hi> in Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and the damned's ſufferings. The dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſuffer the pains of Hell after this life, Chriſt ſuffered the pains of Hell here in this life: <hi>corporal death</hi> is but the beginning of the <hi>damned's puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but Chriſt at his death <hi>finiſhed</hi> his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. So that in the <hi>order</hi> of ſuffering there is ſome difference between what Chriſt ſuffered, and what the damned ſuffer. The damned ſuffer the pains of Hell after this life, Chriſt ſuffered them in this
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:99997:182"/>life; yet Chriſt underwent death as a <hi>part</hi> of the curſe, and death as it is a <hi>part</hi> of the curſe, and a <hi>fruit</hi> of Gods wrath is a terrible thing, yea moſt <hi>terrible;</hi> and yet Chriſt, that he might make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for us, conflicted with this <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,</hi> Chriſt as he was <hi>man,</hi> had a <hi>natural fear</hi> of death, as we have, yet without ſin; and the reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt taking on him our nature, took alſo upon him the <hi>infirmities</hi> of our nature. Now there may be a <hi>natural fear</hi> of death <hi>without ſin,</hi> nature abhorring that which is contrary to it ſelf, and this was in our Saviour. Chriſt being our <hi>Surety,</hi> and ſeeing death coming upon him as part of the curſe, and as a part of the puniſhment due to us for our ſins: this made him to <hi>fear</hi> death. Hence is that expreſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. <hi>He offered up prayers and ſupplications with ſtrong crying and tears to him that was able to ſave him from death, and was heard in what he feared.</hi> Chriſt feared death as he was <hi>man,</hi> eſpecially he feared it as he ſaw it a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>curſe</hi> that was due to us; and yet though he feared it, the thing that he feared came upon him. It is true, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He was heard in what he feared.</hi> How was he heard? Was Chriſt heard ſo as to his <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> as to be delivered from death? No certainly, if Chriſt had not dyed, we muſt have dyed in our ſins. If Chriſt had not dyed, we muſt have undergone death as a part of the curſe. How then is it ſaid, <hi>He was heard in what he feared?</hi> He was heard ſo, as that he was <hi>ſupported</hi> when he dyed, and he was heard in being <hi>raiſed</hi> from the <hi>dead</hi> the <hi>third day;</hi> ſo that he was heard in what he feared, in his <hi>ſupportation</hi> under his ſufferings, and in his <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> but <hi>dye</hi> he muſt, death was part of the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:99997:182"/>curſe, yea the <hi>completion</hi> of the curſe, therefore Chriſt our Surety cannot eſcape death.
<note place="margin">Chriſtus ſponſor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione nobis debitâ feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endus erat.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſays one, <hi>being our Surety, was to be ſtruck with that common curſe that was due to us:</hi> death was due to us, the <hi>great thing threatned</hi> upon ſin, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt being our Surety, muſt of neceſſity undergo it. Hence is that of <hi>Auſtin: Curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> Why is it ſaid, <hi>Every one? That ſo Chriſt himſelf,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>might not be excluded.</hi> Chriſt who was <hi>bleſſed</hi> in his own <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> was yet <hi>accurſed</hi> for our ſins. The curſe prevailed ſo far as to take away Chriſts <hi>life,</hi> to <hi>ſeparate</hi> his <hi>ſoul</hi> from his body. It is true, the curſe could not prevail ſo far, as to ſeparate either from his <hi>perſon,</hi> to ſeparate his ſoul or his body from his perſon; the Perſon of the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, remained <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to the ſoul and body of Chriſt, even when his body and ſoul were ſeparated each from other, and it is our greateſt happineſs that it was ſo, <hi>viz.</hi> that the curſe could not reach the Perſon of Chriſt, if I may ſo expreſs it, that is, reach his Perſon ſo as to diſſolve the Union of the two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; for if the curſe could have reached the Perſon of Chriſt in the ſenſe I am now ſpeaking of, that is, if the curſe could have extended it ſelf to the Perſon of Chriſt, ſo as to diſſolve the Union of the two Natures, this would have made the death of Chriſt <hi>ineffectual;</hi> if death could have diſſolved the <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> Chriſts death would have been no more than the death of a <hi>meer</hi> man, of a <hi>juſt</hi> man, and ſo his death could not have been meritorious, and have ſatisfied for the ſins of the world. But though the curſe could not take hold of Chriſts Perſon, ſo as to diſſolve the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:99997:183"/>union between his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>our nature,</hi> yet the curſe took hold of <hi>our nature united</hi> to Chriſts Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. The curſe did prevail ſo far as to ſeparate his <hi>humane ſoul</hi> from his body. To underſtand this a little more clearly, let us conſider, the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature</hi> in Chriſt was above the Law, and above the curſe: the curſe could not reach his Divine nature, it could not poſſibly hurt that; but now Chriſt having aſſumed <hi>our nature,</hi> and <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily</hi> made himſelf ſubject to the Law and to the curſe in our nature, the Law hath to do with our nature in Chriſt. We being under ſin and under the curſe, the curſe had <hi>dominion</hi> over us; therefore the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That ſin reigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, Rom.</hi> 5.21. Now Chriſt being our <hi>Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and the Law finding our nature in Chriſt, and that Chriſt had transferred the guilt of our ſins upon himſelf, the Law <hi>armed</hi> with the curſe deals with Chriſt as a ſinner, and it proceeds ſo far as to make the utmoſt breach upon our nature that it can, it rends his <hi>holy ſoul</hi> from his <hi>pure body.</hi> And thus <hi>for a time</hi> the curſe ſeems to triumph over our nature as it ſtood in Chriſt. Hence is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. <hi>Chriſt being dead, dyeth no more, death hath no more dominion over him.</hi> This plainly intimates, that death and the curſe had <hi>dominion</hi> over Chriſt for a time, and the curſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo far as to the <hi>extinction</hi> of his <hi>natural</hi> life, his ſoul was ſeparated from his body, though the union between the two natures was not diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>I come to the third and laſt Particular, and that is this: How it was <hi>poſſible</hi> for this to be; Chriſt was moſt <hi>bleſſed</hi> in himſelf, how then was it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for him thus to be <hi>made a curſe?</hi> The curſe
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:99997:183"/>implies <hi>anger, wrath, diſpleaſure</hi> in him that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth and inflicts it, as hath been ſhewn: how then was it poſſible for Chriſt to ſuffer the wrath of God, that was always <hi>beloved</hi> of God?</p>
                  <p>To this ſeveral things are to be anſwered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider Chriſt in <hi>himſelf,</hi> and ſo he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>beloved</hi> of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Iſa. 42.1. <hi>Behold mine Elect in whom my ſoul delighteth.</hi> And Chriſt as he was <hi>man</hi> had more <hi>titles</hi> than one to his Fathers love.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt had a title to his Fathers <hi>love,</hi> as his <hi>Humanity</hi> is taken into ſo <hi>near</hi> a <hi>relation</hi> to the <hi>natural Son</hi> of God. The <hi>humane nature</hi> in Chriſt is made <hi>one</hi> in perſon with the <hi>natural</hi> Son of God, ſo that there is not <hi>another ſubſiſtence</hi> of the ſecond Perſon in Trinity and the humane nature; but there is one <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> to the ſecond Perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and to the humane nature: therefore the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature being <hi>taken in,</hi> as it were, to have its <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> in the perſon of the <hi>natural</hi> Son of God, being taken into the <hi>unity</hi> of the <hi>ſame perſon,</hi> muſt needs be <hi>beloved</hi> of the Father, upon that account, above all <hi>creatures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt is <hi>beloved</hi> of the Father as he is a <hi>juſt</hi> and an <hi>innocent</hi> perſon, and he muſt needs be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the Father upon that account, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.8. <hi>The Lord loveth the righteous.</hi> Chriſt being a <hi>juſt</hi> and a <hi>righteous</hi> p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ſon, the Father could not but love him as conſidered in himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Father loved Chriſt upon the account of his <hi>obedience, Joh.</hi> 10.17. <hi>Therefore doth my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther love me, becauſe I lay down my life for my ſheep:</hi> and in the next verſe, <hi>This commandment have I received of my Father.</hi> Chriſt <hi>obeying</hi> his Father
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:99997:184"/>in laying down his life for his ſheep, is one title he hath to his Fathers love; therefore conſider Chriſt in himſelf, ſo he was always beloved of the Father.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt ſuffered the <hi>wrath</hi> of God as he was our <hi>Surety,</hi> and as he ſtood in our <hi>ſtead,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered for us.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Chriſt hath once ſuffered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> This is a clear Text, Chriſt was a juſt perſon in himſelf, and as he was a <hi>juſt perſon,</hi> ſo he was always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of God, and could not but be beloved of him. But now as he that was a <hi>juſt perſon</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gave himſelf to ſuffer for the <hi>unjuſt,</hi> ſo it was that he bare the <hi>wrath</hi> of God. The <hi>wrath</hi> of God was due to the <hi>unjuſt, Tribulation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, indignation and wrath upon every ſoul of man that doth evil, Rom</hi> 2. Therefore if the <hi>juſt</hi> will ſuffer for the <hi>unjuſt</hi> in their <hi>room</hi> and <hi>ſtead,</hi> he muſt then ſuffer what they muſt have ſuffered. It is a true ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin:

                           <hi>Mors Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti fuit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis, non crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> Aug.</note> The death which Chriſt underwent was not in reſpect of any crime or offence that he himſelf had committed,</hi> but it was in reſpect of the <hi>condition</hi> that he brought himſelf into; that is, Chriſt ſuffered the wrath of God, not for any crime or offence of his own, but in the condition of a <hi>Mediator,</hi> becauſe of our ſins. Hence is it ſaid, That <hi>he was delivered up for our offences, Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult.</hi> So in that of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him.</hi> Chriſt took upon him the <hi>diſcharge</hi> and <hi>payment</hi> of our <hi>debt;</hi> therefore though he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways beloved of God in himſelf, yet as <hi>perſonating</hi> and <hi>repreſenting</hi> us who were ſinners, ſo it was that he ſuſtained the wrath of God. <hi>All we like ſheep
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:99997:184"/>have gone aſtray,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all, Iſa.</hi> 53.6. We were the <hi>offenders,</hi> and yet the <hi>puniſhment</hi> was laid upon Chriſt who was an innocent perſon. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a good expreſſion of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">Non ille maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, ſed in te maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt was not accurſed in himſelf, but he was accurſed in thee.</hi> It was <hi>we</hi> that deſerved the curſe, the <hi>curſe</hi> was <hi>due</hi> to us, but the curſe <hi>lighted</hi> upon Chriſt, that ſo it might not fall upon us: Therefore it is wiſely obſerved by another of the Ancients, That no one ought to be offended at this, that Chriſt is ſaid to be made a curſe, who himſelf was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin: <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe,
<note place="margin">Factus eſt ille maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus, non natus.</note> he was not born a curſe.</hi> Chriſt was moſt free from the curſe in himſelf, but he moſt voluntarily took the curſe upon him. Therefore another of the Ancients obſerves: <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe,
<note place="margin">Non per ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitatem, ſed per obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiam.</note> not out of neceſſity, but in a way of obedience.</hi> He was made <hi>under the Law,</hi> and therefore he <hi>ſubjected</hi> himſelf to the curſe of the Law: he that would be made under the Law muſt undergo all that the Law required of him: now the Law required <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> and the Law requires <hi>ſuffering;</hi> therefore Chriſt being <hi>made under the Law</hi> muſt not only do, but ſuffer what the Law requires. Divines obſerve, That Chriſt was <hi>born</hi> and <hi>dyed</hi> after a ſpecial Law different from other men. Chriſt was <hi>born,</hi> not for himſelf, but for others, and he <hi>dyed,</hi> not for himſelf, but for others;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Manifeſtum eſt Chriſtum potuiſſe non mori, ſed voluiſſe, ut mors ſua nobis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſet.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſ.</note> Chriſt is to be conſidered as a <hi>common perſon.</hi> Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Chriſts bearing the curſe was not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for others, Chriſt ſuffered and underwent the wrath of God which we ſhould have born.

                  <p>THere is one thing more to be anſwered to that inquiry (to make the anſwer full and compleat, over and above what was ſaid in the laſt Diſcourſe) How was it poſſible for Chriſt to ſuffer the wrath of God that was always <hi>beloved</hi> of him?</p>
                  <p>The third thing therefore that is to be ſaid is this: It was poſſible for Chriſt by <hi>faith</hi> to know that he was <hi>beloved</hi> of God, and he did know that he was <hi>beloved</hi> of God, when yet as to <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>feeling</hi> he <hi>taſted</hi> of Gods <hi>wrath. Faith</hi> and the want of <hi>ſenſe</hi> are not inconſiſtent; there may be no <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſenſe</hi> of Gods <hi>love,</hi> nay there may be a <hi>preſent ſenſe</hi> of his <hi>wrath,</hi> and yet there may be <hi>faith</hi> at the ſame time. This is manifeſt from that deſcription of <hi>faith</hi> which the Apoſtle gives, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen. Faith</hi> makes thoſe things <hi>evident,</hi> which are not <hi>evident</hi> and <hi>apparent</hi> unto ſenſe. This alſo is manifeſt from the <hi>experience</hi> of ſeveral of the Saints. It is ſaid of <hi>Abraham,</hi> That <hi>he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in hope, againſt hope, Rom.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Abraham</hi> had the <hi>hope</hi> of faith againſt the dictates of <hi>ſenſe,</hi> his faith prevailed againſt <hi>ſenſe,</hi> he believed when all things in ſenſe made againſt him. Thus was it with <hi>Job,</hi> in one place he ſaith, That <hi>God hunted him
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:99997:186"/>as a fierce lyon,</hi> and that <hi>he ſhewed himſelf amrvellous upon him.</hi> And yet in another place he ſaith, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> Here was faith againſt ſenſe. In like manner in another place he ſaith, That God <hi>counted him for his enemy:</hi> in his ſenſe and feeling God ſeemed as an enemy to him. And yet in another place he ſaith, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth.</hi> Here was an oppoſition to ſenſe. Thus was it with <hi>Heman,</hi> he complains <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.7. That Gods <hi>wrath lay hard upon him,</hi> that God <hi>had afflicted him with all his waves:</hi> and in the ſixteenth verſe of that Pſalm he ſaith, <hi>Thy fierce wrath goeth over me:</hi> and yet in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Pſalm he calls God, the <hi>God of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, O Lord God of my ſalvation, verſ.</hi> 1. here was faith contradicting ſenſe. Thus was it with our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chriſtus li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cèt ſe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lictum ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiret, ut in nobis fuit, tamen in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexit in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſemper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amatum fuiſſe.</note> our Saviour had a preſent ſenſe and feeling of Gods wrath, and yet by faith he might know he was beloved of God. Hence is that of a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man: <hi>Chriſt although he felt himſelf forſaken, as he was in us, yet he underſtood that he was always beloved, conſidered as in himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I ſpoken that which I think may be ſufficient for the clearing of that objection, How Chriſt that was a perſon always <hi>beloved</hi> of God, could yet bear the ſenſe of his wrath.</p>
                  <p>And now I would make a little farther uſe of what hath been opened as to Chriſts <hi>being made a curſe,</hi> and then I ſhall proceed to the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions that remain for the clearing the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt, as we have heard, hath been <hi>made a curſe,</hi> the <hi>wrath</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> of God hath been poured forth upon him; whatever he underwent upon the Croſs, all that <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>pain,</hi> all that
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:99997:187"/>
                     <hi>grief</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> which he felt in <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body</hi> was the effect of Gods wrath, the puniſhment due to us for our ſins, the <hi>wrath</hi> of God was <hi>conſummated</hi> upon him, and he was cut off by the curſe, he underwent <hi>death</hi> as part of the <hi>curſe.</hi> Let us ſee what uſe may be made of this.</p>
                  <p>This may ſerve by way of <hi>direction</hi> to us, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> to teach us what courſe to take when we are in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and <hi>agony</hi> of <hi>conſcience,</hi> under the fear and terror of Gods wrath due to us for ſin. Who is there among us, that ſome time or other may not lye under the fear of Gods wrath? that may not be <hi>terrified</hi> with the <hi>apprehenſion</hi> of Gods wrath due to him for ſin? Now the <hi>proper relief</hi> in this caſe is to conſider that <hi>Chriſt was made a curſe.</hi> If Chriſt hath <hi>felt</hi> what we fear, if he hath <hi>ſuffered</hi> and undergone what we <hi>deſerved,</hi> what ſo proper a ground to relieve us as this? We fear the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, and Chriſt hath ſuffered that <hi>wrath.</hi> This is the caſe of many of the children of God, they do many times lye under <hi>dreadful apprehenſions</hi> of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure. <hi>David</hi> in the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and anguiſh of his ſoul crys out, <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence, Pſal.</hi> 51.11. And that <hi>Saint</hi> we mentioned even now in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88.14. <hi>Lord, why casteſt thou off my ſoul?</hi> Now when we begin to apprehend, that God hath caſt us off in <hi>diſpleaſure;</hi> when we are under <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>anguiſh</hi> of ſoul, and apprehend that God is highly incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and his wrath is waxed hot againſt us, what can give us relief in this caſe, but to conſider that Gods wrath was <hi>poured out</hi> to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> upon Chriſt our <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Surety,</hi> that the <hi>wrath</hi> of God <hi>ſpent</hi> it ſelf, and had a full vent upon him? This therefore is the only courſe we can take,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:99997:187"/>when we are under the fear and apprehenſion of Gods wrath, to lift up Chriſt in the arms of our faith, and to interpoſe him between us and the wrath of an angry God. <hi>If his wrath be kindled but a little, bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in Chriſt, Pſal.</hi> 2.12. This <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſt being <hi>made a curſe</hi> is of marvellous and unſpeakable uſe in the ſerious exerciſes of faith, when the ſoul is under ſore <hi>conflicts</hi> from the fear of Gods wrath. If thou art burdened with the guilt of ſin, and the fear of Gods <hi>wrath,</hi> thou mayſt go to God and tell him, that Chriſt hath ſuffered as much as ever thou haſt deſerved to ſuffer; that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he may juſtly inflict upon thee, but it hath already been executed and inflicted upon Chriſt to the uttermoſt; and will he puniſh ſin twice? Will he puniſh ſin in thee, and will he puniſh it in the perſon of his <hi>innocent</hi> Son, who had no ſin of his own, but only took upon him their cauſe that were not able to deliver themſelves from wrath?</p>
                  <p>From this Doctrine of Chriſts being <hi>made a curſe,</hi> 
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> we may learn what the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote</hi> is againſt the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>death.</hi> The <hi>proper Antidote</hi> againſt the <hi>fear of death</hi> is this, That Chriſt hath ſuffered death as <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>curſe;</hi> therefore Chriſt having undergone death for us as a <hi>part</hi> of the curſe, if we be in Chriſt, the <hi>curſe of death</hi> is taken away from us. It is true, Believers undergo death ſtill, but here lyes the comfort to a Believer, that death is no longer a <hi>curſe</hi> to him, Chriſt by undergoing death as a <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>curſe,</hi> yea as the <hi>completion</hi> of the curſe hath taken away death as it is a curſe. Death is now no more a <hi>curſe</hi> unto Believers, but a paſſage unto life. It is a
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:99997:188"/>ſweet Text, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. <hi>O death I will be thy plague, O grave I will be thy deſtruction.</hi> Chriſt by <hi>dying</hi> hath <hi>deſtroyed</hi> and <hi>overcome</hi> death, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are freed from <hi>death</hi> as a <hi>curſe;</hi> therefore is it that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that believes on him ſhall never dye, Joh.</hi> 11.26. What better news to any of the ſons and daughters of men, than to tell them they ſhall never dye? Our Saviour aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us of this, He that believes on him ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.26.</p>
                  <p>O but do not Believers dye as well as other men? <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>I proceed now to ſome other Propoſitions for the clearing the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next Propoſition therefore is this.</p>
                  <p>The eleventh Propoſition, God hath charged
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:99997:188"/>upon Chriſt the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> of the ſins of his people. There is an <hi>act</hi> of God in this, Chriſt did not only ſuffer ſuch things as we have heard, but he hath ſuffered them from the <hi>hand</hi> of God, laying theſe things upon him as our <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Surety.</hi> Hence is it ſaid, That <hi>God hath made him to be ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>God hath laid upon him the iniquities of us all,</hi> Iſa. 53.6. <hi>God hath laid upon him:</hi> there is the act of God, the act of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice</hi> put forth in <hi>laying</hi> upon Chriſt all the puniſhment that he underwent. Hence are thoſe expreſſions that are ſo frequent in Scripture, that Chriſt was <hi>made ſin, made under the Law,</hi> that he was <hi>made a curſe,</hi> that he was made of God to us <hi>Redemption:</hi> all which expreſſions plainly ſhew, that there was an act of God put forth, whereby Chriſt is made or appointed of God to be our Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that God did exact that debt of obedience and puniſhment from Chriſt which we ſhould have performed. This is of marvellous ſweet conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to conſider, that the guilt and puniſhment of our ſins is taken off from us, and transferred upon Chriſt our Surety. Not but that we are <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> ſtill conſidered in our ſelves, and that we are <hi>obnoxious</hi> unto puniſhment as we are <hi>Sinners</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as in our ſelves; but here lyes the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to conſider that ſuch is the free grace of God towards us, that he hath <hi>transferred</hi> the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> of our ſins upon Chriſt our Surety, and exacts that from Chriſt, who ſtands in the place of our Surety, that he might have exacted from us, who were the principal debtors. Thus we read of the <hi>ſcape Goat,</hi> that the iniquities of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were put upon him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.21. <hi>Aaron was to lay his hand upon the head of the ſcape
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:99997:189"/>Goat, and to confeſs over him the ſins and iniquities of the Children of Iſrael, and he was to put them upon the head of the Goat.</hi> So the expreſſion is in the Text, <hi>Putting their ſins upon him.</hi> The ſcape Goat was certainly a Type of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chriſtus peccata no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra in ſe tranſtulit.</hi> Calvin.</note> and herein was intimated, as <hi>Calvin</hi> well obſerves, <hi>That Chriſt did transfer our ſins upon himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The twelfth Propoſition is, That Chriſt as our Surety did <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> offer himſelf to ſuffer what we ſhould have ſuffered. As God did charge our ſins upon Chriſt, and laid the guilt and puniſhment of them upon him, ſo Chriſt our Head and Surety did freely and voluntarily offer himſelf to ſuffer what we ſhould have ſuffered; as the Father did charge upon Chriſt the payment of our debts, ſo Chriſt did freely and voluntarily take upon him the payment of them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>He was afflicted and he was oppreſſed:</hi> the vulgar Latine renders it,
<note place="margin">Oblatus eſt, quia ipſe voluit.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt was offered, becauſe he himſelf would.</hi> Had he not been <hi>willing,</hi> he might have choſen whether he would have been offered; but he freely offers himſelf, <hi>No man taketh away his life, but he lays down his life for his ſheep, he lays it down of himſelf, Joh.</hi> 10.15. This is a marvellous ſweet conſideration: Look as the <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of the <hi>firſt Adam</hi> was <hi>voluntary,</hi> ſo the <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> of Chriſt our <hi>Surety</hi> was voluntary: <hi>Adam</hi> did voluntarily break and tranſgreſs the Law of God, and Chriſt our Surety did voluntarily obey the Law. <hi>Adam</hi> ſinning deſerved <hi>puniſhment</hi> for that ſin, and Chriſt did <hi>voluntarily</hi> undergo that puniſhment. Hence is it, that <hi>Adams diſobedience</hi> and Chriſts <hi>obedience</hi> are compared together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one many ſhall be made
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:99997:189"/>righteous. Adam</hi> was not more <hi>voluntary</hi> in his <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>diſobedience,</hi> than Chriſt our Surety was <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> in his obedience. Much of the <hi>dignity</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of Chriſts Satisfaction is to be ſeen in this, That as ſin was <hi>voluntarily</hi> committed in <hi>our nature,</hi> ſo <hi>obedience</hi> was performed voluntarily in our nature, and ſuffering was voluntarily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in it by him who was our <hi>Surety.</hi> Look as ſin was <hi>voluntarily</hi> committed in the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man</hi> by the <hi>first Adam,</hi> ſo we have the ſame <hi>nature</hi> of man in the perſon of the <hi>ſecond Adam, voluntarily obeying</hi> and <hi>voluntarily ſuffering</hi> whatever Divine Juſtice would require from us: and when we come to tranſact things between God and our ſouls in the matters of our ſalvation, we ſhall find theſe things of infinite concernment more than now we may be aware of. This alſo is farther to be conſidered, That as Chriſt <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>voluntarily</hi> offered himſelf to ſuffer for us, ſo he did offer himſelf to ſuffer for us with this intention to make <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for our ſins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. <hi>The Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter and to give his life a ranſom for many.</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks here of the end of his coming, it was the end of his <hi>Incarnation</hi> to give his life a ranſom for many; and this was his <hi>intention</hi> in his death to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for our ſins, <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep,</hi> that is, I do it <hi>intentionally</hi> for the good of my ſheep, <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, Joh.</hi> 17.19.</p>
                  <p>The thirteenth Propoſition is, God having <hi>charged</hi> upon Chriſt the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> of our ſins, and Chriſt having <hi>freely</hi> and <hi>voluntarily offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> himſelf to ſuffer what we ſhould have ſuffered, and having <hi>actually ſuffered</hi> what we ſhould have
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:99997:190"/>ſuffered, Divine Juſtice can now <hi>demand</hi> no more. Here lyes the very <hi>eſſence</hi> of ſatisfaction. The School men deſcribe ſatisfaction to be <hi>a voluntary rendring of that which is equivalent of ſomewhat which was otherwiſe not due,
<note place="margin">Redditio voluntaria aequivalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, aliàs indebiti.</note> for ſome wrong or injury that hath been done.</hi> Alſo they tell us that <hi>ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> ſpeaks ſome <hi>compenſation</hi> that is commenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or correſpondent to ſome <hi>precedent injury,</hi> and that this muſt be voluntary; for if it be not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, it is not ſo properly <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> as <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</hi> Take a damned ſoul in Hell, from whom puniſhment is exacted for the ſins that he hath committed, ſuch an one bears puniſhment; but he doth not ſatisfie properly, becauſe he doth not ſuffer voluntarily; and therefore the torments of the damned never expiate and take away ſin, although they ſtill detain and keep the perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power and hand of Divine Juſtice. But now where there is a <hi>voluntary ſubmiſſion</hi> unto pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and this puniſhment is <hi>equivalent</hi> to the offence committed, and as much as Juſtice can require, this is properly <hi>ſatisfaction:</hi> and this makes the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of our Saviour moſt perfect and compleat; where the perſon that <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> the <hi>ſatisfaction, tenders</hi> as much as the perſon <hi>wronged</hi> and <hi>injured</hi> can require by way of compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; and when the perſon that hath <hi>received wrong</hi> and <hi>injury,</hi> receives as much by way of <hi>repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> as is ſuitable to the wrong and injury that is done to him, and as much as he deſires, here is <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> Now Chriſt hath made a full <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation</hi> to Divine Juſtice, the <hi>utmoſt puniſhment</hi> that the Law could inflict upon us as we are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chriſt hath voluntarily undergone, he hath ſuffered that <hi>grief,</hi> thoſe <hi>pains,</hi> that <hi>death</hi> of the
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:99997:190"/>body which we deſerved; he hath undergone thoſe <hi>dolors,</hi> thoſe <hi>perplexities</hi> in his mind, that <hi>dereliction,</hi> that <hi>curſe</hi> in his ſoul that was due to us; therefore the <hi>whole puniſhment</hi> which the Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, being executed upon Chriſt our Surety. Divine Juſtice can demand no more. When the <hi>penalty</hi> that the Law demands, and is pronounced againſt ſuch a <hi>crime</hi> is undergone, the Law is ſatisfied, it can demand no more. If a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a crime worthy of death, all that which the Law requires is death; if <hi>death</hi> be undergone, if the perſon be cut off from the land of the living, the Law is <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> and can demand no more. Now the Law hath had its full force and ſtroke upon Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>He was cut off from the land of the living.</hi> Now the curſe of the Law being poured out upon Chriſt, the Law hath no more to demand. When there is a full <hi>payment</hi> made, there is no more <hi>debt</hi> can be exacted; Chriſts <hi>obedience</hi> was <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat,</hi> there remained nothing more for him to ſuffer: Therefore is it ſaid, That <hi>he hath brought in everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Dan. 9.24. <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14. <hi>Who was delivered up for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification, Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>ult.</hi> Chriſt was delivered up for our offences, that is, delivered up to death, Chriſt in dying bare the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> of our ſins, but he was <hi>raiſed again for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now if Chriſt had not <hi>ſatisfied</hi> and <hi>diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> the debt to the utmoſt, he could not have been raiſed for <hi>our juſtification;</hi> for if there had been any part of the puniſhment not <hi>ſuffered,</hi> the Law might have exacted part of us: but, ſaith the Text, <hi>Chriſt was raiſed again for our juſtification.</hi>
                     <pb n="364" facs="tcp:99997:191"/>Therefore it is plain and evident, that Chriſt in dying bare the whole puniſhment that the Law would have inflicted upon us. When the <hi>debt</hi> is paid, the priſoner is let out of priſon: Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Surety was under an <hi>arreſt</hi> by the Law and by Divine Juſtice; but now Chriſt our Surety having fully paid the debt, Chriſt is <hi>releaſed</hi> out of priſon, having paid the debt which he owed, in his ſufferings, he is <hi>raiſed</hi> again for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was an <hi>evidence</hi> that our <hi>debt</hi> was fully paid and diſcharged by our Surety. Hence alſo is that of our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8, 9. <hi>The Spirit ſhall convince the world of ſin, of righteouſneſs, and of judgment.</hi> Why of <hi>righteouſneſs? Becauſe I go to the Father.</hi> Chriſts <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> into Heaven was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain evidence that Chriſt was a <hi>righteous</hi> perſon. For if Chriſt had not fully anſwered the Law, he had never been raiſed up from the dead, and taken up into glory, he had been detained and kept in priſon ſtill; and the reaſon is plainly, that which was intimated before, that Chriſt was not <hi>born</hi> for <hi>himſelf,</hi> nor <hi>dyed</hi> for <hi>himſelf,</hi> but he was born a common perſon, he was born for us, and dyed for us; therefore Chriſt being a common perſon and our Surety, and ſo tranſacting our cauſe, the Law would not have been ſatisfied, neither would Divine Juſtice have been quieted, till all that had been undergone that we deſerved. Therefore when it is ſaid, that Chriſt went to his Father after his ſuffering; and when it is ſaid, <hi>He was delivered for our offences, and raiſed again for our juſtification,</hi> it is plain and evident, that the Law and Juſtice had taken their fill of Chriſt, and had nothing more to demand of him.</p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:99997:191"/>
                  <p>The fourteenth Propoſition is, That Divine Juſtice being ſatisfied in what Chriſt hath ſuffered, God <hi>acquits</hi> and <hi>diſcharges</hi> Believers from the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> of their ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemns? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> It is as much as if the Apoſtle ſhould ſay, A Believer is acquitted and diſcharged from the guilt of his ſins, no one can lay any thing to his charge, becauſe God hath <hi>juſtified</hi> him, no one can <hi>condemn</hi> him, becauſe Chriſt hath born the puniſhment that he ſhould have born, <hi>who is he that condemns? it is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> A Believer is not liable to <hi>condemnation,</hi> becauſe Chriſt hath been <hi>condemned</hi> for him, and the Law hath ſate in Judgment upon Chriſt, and hath <hi>arraigned</hi> and condemned him: now the Law is not wont to puniſh the ſame crime <hi>twice.</hi> The Juſtice of God having puniſhed ſin in Chriſt the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Surety</hi> of the Elect, will not puniſh ſin the <hi>ſecond time</hi> in Believers themſelves. It is a good expreſſion of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Caput &amp; corpus unus eſt Chriſtus: ſatisfecit ergo caput pro mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus pro viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceribus ſuis.</hi> Ambroſ.</note> 
                     <hi>The head and body are but one Chriſt; Chriſt therefore being the head, hath ſatisfied for his members, Chriſt hath ſatisfied for Believers who are his own bowels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The laſt Propoſition is this, That Chriſts <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> hath <hi>merit</hi> in it; though <hi>merit</hi> and <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> are near akin, yet they are diſtinct <hi>notions.</hi> Satisfaction doth properly ſignifie the turning away of ſome evil that is impending, and Merit properly reſpects ſome good to be procured. Now Chriſt by his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> doth not only <hi>turn away</hi> that <hi>evil</hi> from us that we deſerve, but he alſo <hi>merits</hi> and <hi>procures good</hi> for us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt by his <hi>Satisfaction turns away evil</hi> from
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:99997:192"/>us. He turns away the <hi>wrath</hi> of God from us, he turns away the <hi>curſes</hi> of the Law, and all the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of Divine wrath: <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us.</hi> Hence alſo is that expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.26. <hi>The Redeemer ſhall come from Zion, and turn away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs from Jacob,</hi> that is, he ſhall turn away the <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>puniſhment</hi> of ſin from Believers, he ſhall turn away all the <hi>evils</hi> and <hi>miſeries</hi> that ſin would bring upon us: <hi>His name ſhall be called Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins, Mat.</hi> 1. But this is not all, Chriſt by his Satisfaction doth not only turn away evil, but</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He procures <hi>good</hi> for us, he procures <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> and the favour of God, the Spirit, the grace of the Spirit, and eternal life for us. The <hi>Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings</hi> of Chriſt have <hi>merit</hi> in them to purchaſe good things for us. Hence is that expreſſion of our Saviour in the <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the Supper, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my blood.</hi> The meaning is, that all the good things in the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> all the bleſſings comprehended in the Covenant of Grace are purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt. The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> is the <hi>Charter</hi> in which all good things are contained, and all theſe things are the purchaſe of the blood of Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>IT remains now that I ſhould come to make ſome <hi>general Application</hi> of this great Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction. Although there have been ſome particular Uſes of this Doctrine all along in the ſeveral branches of it; yet it may be meet in the cloſe to annex ſome general Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication as to the whole Doctrine about Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Uſe ſhall be an Uſe of <hi>Confutation,</hi> to confute the <hi>Adverſaries</hi> of this Truth. There are two great Adverſaries to this Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Socinians,</hi> who deny the Satisfaction of Chriſt altogether.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who bring in other Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons beſides that of Chriſt's.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>Socinians;</hi> they are the moſt <hi>profeſſed Adverſaries</hi> to the Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they tell us, that the ſufferings of Chriſt were only a kind of <hi>Martyrdom,</hi> that Chriſt dyed to <hi>confirm</hi> the truth that he had preached, alſo that his ſufferings were for an <hi>example;</hi> but they whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny, that what Chriſt ſuffered had any influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as to the ſatisfying of Gods Juſtice. Now the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction</hi> that hath
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:99997:193"/>been opened doth oppugn this aſſertion of theirs; for it hath been proved at large, that Chriſt hath ſuffered the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of what we ought to have ſuffered, and that what Chriſt did ſuffer was with this intention,

It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſpeech of one of the Ancients: <hi>Although,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the death of many of the Saints hath been precious in the ſight of God, yet notwithſtanding the death of no innocent perſon, beſides Chriſt himſelf, was the propitiation for the world.</hi> It is the expreſſion which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> uſeth, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. where he tells us, That Chriſt <hi>is the propitiation for the ſins of the whole world.</hi> Though the deaths of the Martyrs were <hi>precious,</hi> yet none of their deaths was the <hi>propitiation</hi> for the <hi>ſins</hi> of the world: and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:99997:193"/>then our Author goes on:
<note place="margin">Acceperunt juſti, non dederunt coronas, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empla nata ſunt patien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae, non do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na juſtitiae.</note> 
                     <hi>Thoſe juſt perſons who have been martyred for the truth, have received, not given Crowns, and from the courage and fortitude of the Martyrs in their ſufferings, we have examples of patience afforded to us, not any gifts of merit. Theirs were but ſingle deaths that were undergone by them, neither doth one pay anothers debt, there was only one Lord Jeſus Chriſt found among the ſons of men, in whom all were crucified, all have dyed, all have riſen again.</hi> They who deny and take away the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction, endeavour to take from us a principal part of the Goſpel, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from us the principal pillar of all our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport; for one of the great Truths which the Goſpel reveals, is the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt for the juſtification of a ſinner. So the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for therein is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith.</hi> The Apoſtle here gives us an account of the Goſpel, what it is that the Goſpel reveals, it reveals to us the Righteouſneſs of God; the great and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Truth revealed in the Goſpel, is that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs whereby men may be juſtified in the ſight of God. What this righteouſneſs is, the Apoſtle doth more fully make known to us in another place of this Epiſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God, to declare, I ſay, at this time his righteouſneſs.</hi> So that the righteouſneſs which the Goſpel reveals is, That God is willing to pardon ſinners, and to accept them as righteous upon the account of the death and ſufferings of his Son, and upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:99997:194"/>of the ſatisfaction which he hath made. So that they who go about to ſubvert the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, do in effect <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> the whole Goſpel, and do as much as lyes in them <hi>diſannul</hi> it. For if the ſcope of the Goſpel be to reveal the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Chriſt, which is the reſult of his death and ſufferings, the reſult of his obedience active and paſſive; then they that would take away this, would take away a main part of the Goſpel from us. So likewiſe, as the denying of Chriſts Satisfaction is the overthrow of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of the Goſpel: ſo it is that which takes away the main pillar of our comfort. For if Chriſt hath not <hi>ſatisfied for us,</hi> we are ſtill liable to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Juſtice of God in our own perſons, for God is a <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> God. He hath ſaid, That he will by no means <hi>clear the guilty,</hi> and the ſentence of the Law remains firm upon us, <hi>That the ſoul that ſins ſhall dye,</hi> and <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the Law to do them.</hi> Therefore unleſs Chriſt hath made ſatisfaction for us, all theſe things muſt of neceſſity ſtand firm againſt us: un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be a <hi>ranſom</hi> found for us, we are ſtill liable to anſwer to Divine Juſtice. It is a great Scripture to confirm this, <hi>Job</hi> 33.23, 24. <hi>If there be a meſſenger with him, an interpreter one of a thouſand, to ſhew unto man his uprightneſs, then is he gracious to him, and ſaith, Deliver him, I have found a ranſom for him. To ſhew unto man his uprightneſs.</hi> The <hi>uprightneſs</hi> here ſpoken of is conceived by Learned men, not the <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of man himſelf, but the <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of God. <hi>To ſhew unto man his uprightneſs,</hi> that is, the <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of God. What is this <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of God? It is Gods <hi>uprightneſs</hi> in
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:99997:194"/>dealing with man according to the tenour of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-grace. Compare this with <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Here we have a deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the tenour of Goſpel grace; the grace of the Goſpel conſiſts in this, <hi>That we are juſtified freely by Gods grace through the redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now this is the <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of God, Gods dealing with men according to the tenour of his grace promulgated in the Goſpel. God having diſcovered this to be his mind, that he will pardon mens ſins upon the account of the death and ſufferings of his Son: when this <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs</hi> of God is thus diſcovered to men, and they by faith lay hold of the grace of God thus promulgated and made known to them, then God hath found a ranſom. Now when God hath found a ranſom for men, then he ſaith, <hi>Deliver them, then is he gracious,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Deliver him from going down into the pit, for I have found a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for him.</hi> Had there not been a ranſom found for us, there had been no deliverance from the pit of deſtruction: here lies all our comfort,
<note place="margin">Homo qui debuit, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo qui ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Propter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem ſic dictum eſt per Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum: nam nos peccato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in ipſo infernales poenas, quae juſtè mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bamur, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olvimus.</note> That Chriſt hath born what we ſhould have born, he hath ſuffered what we ſhould have ſuffered. <hi>It was man that owed the debt, and man that paid the debt.</hi> It is a memorable paſſage of a Learned man: <hi>For our Juſtification it was that Chriſt was ſo dealt with; for we ſinners have ſuffered and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in Chriſt thoſe very pains of Hell which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who bring in other ſatisfactions beſides that of Chriſt. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> tell us, That a man by ſome good act, as they call it, an act
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:99997:195"/>of charity or love to God, may ſatisfie for ſin; alſo they tell us, That we may make ſatisfaction by external works, as by Faſting, Prayers, and Almſgiving, and the like: alſo ſome of them have affirmed, That one man may make ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to Divine Juſtice for another. But all theſe aſſertions are impious and moſt derogatory to the honour of our Saviours Satisfaction. For if it had been poſſible for us to have ſatisfied Divine Juſtice our ſelves, what need our Saviour have ſuffered and undergone ſuch things as we have heard? Beſides the Scripture teaches us, That <hi>by one offering Chriſt hath for ever perfected them that are ſanctified, Heb.</hi> 10.14. That <hi>one Sacrifice</hi> of his was ſufficient to make <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> for ſin; therefore if Chriſts Satisfaction were ſufficient, whatever is done by us muſt needs be ſuperfluous upon that account. If that <hi>one offering</hi> of Chriſt were enough, there is no need of other ſatisfactions of mens invention and bringing in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Chriſt hath appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>

Chriſt by his Sacrifice hath taken away the condemning power of ſin wholly; ſo that the power which ſin had before to condemn us, is perfectly abrogated and cancelled. Therefore there is no need of humane ſatisfactions, or if there were need of ſome ſatisfaction to be made by us, what ſhould we be able to bring to ſatisfie God? <hi>Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of rams, or ten thouſands of rivers of oyl, ſhall we give the fruit of our body for the ſin of our ſoul?</hi> as the Prophet expreſſeth it, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.7. If we ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any of theſe things, none of theſe would
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:99997:195"/>be able to ſatisfie God, what then will become of all the <hi>Popiſh Satisfactions?</hi> They tell us indeed, That an act of love to God, eſpecially if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe and ſtrong, may ſatisfie for ſin; but how can that ſatisfie for a crime committed, which is in it ſelf due, and a juſt debt? Love to God, yea the higheſt degree of love is a juſt debt that we owe to God. The firſt and great Commandment of the Law is, That we ſhould <hi>love the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our ſoul, with all our ſtrength, with all our might.</hi> Therefore it is not poſſible, that by any <hi>good act,</hi> as they call it, we ſhould ſatisfie God for any ſin committed by us; and the reaſon is, becauſe that good act was a thing due, that which is a juſt debt in it ſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſatisfie for a former debt. Beſides there is no proportion between the act of a finite creature to make ſatisfaction, and an infinite Majeſty that is offended. And whereas they ſuppoſe that ſome external works, as Faſting, Alms, Penances, and the like, may pacifie God, and make <hi>ſatisfaction for ſin,</hi> this proceeds from groſs ignorance of the Nature of God, and of the nature of ſin. For if God be infinitely holy, and do infinitely hate ſin; and if God be infinitely juſt, that he cannot but puniſh ſin, and that in the higheſt manner; and if the demerit and deſert of ſin be ſuch, as that it deſerves no leſs than the wrath of God and the torments of Hell, it is very ridiculous to imagine, that the Juſtice of God ſhould be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſuch pitiful things as men may impoſe upon themſelves. And that one man, who is but a meer man, ſhould be able to ſatisfie for another, this is much more abſurd. For if a man be not able to ſatisfie for himſelf, how is it
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:99997:196"/>poſſible that he ſhould ſatisfie for another?

                  <p>The ſecond Uſe is by way of Exhortation. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> Let us be exhorted to make uſe of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and to have recourſe to it upon all occaſions in our approaches unto God, this is in effect the uſe which the <hi>Author</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> makes of the Doctrine of Chriſts <hi>Prieſthood:</hi> Chriſts <hi>Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> belongs to his Prieſtly Office, and is a principal part of it. Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is that act of his Prieſtly Office whereby he offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to God to make atonement for our ſins. Now we ought by faith to have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual recourſe to this great and eternal Sacrifice of the Son of God. This is the Uſe which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle teaches us to make of the great Doctrine of Chriſts Prieſthood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20, &amp;c. <hi>Having therefore, brethren, boldneſs to enter into the holieſt, by the blood of Jeſus, by a new and living way which he hath conſecrated for us through the veil, that is to ſay, his fleſh, and having an High Prieſt over the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:99997:196"/>houſe of God, let us draw near with a pure heart in full aſſurance of faith. Having therefore boldneſs to enter into the holieſt by the blood of Jeſus:</hi> it is the <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt that lays the foundation for out acceſs to God, and our acceptance with him. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>By the blood of Jeſus,</hi> is a Synecdoche, a part being put for the whole, the blood of Chriſt ſignifies his whole ſufferings, that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his, and the work of his <hi>Satisfaction</hi> upon the Croſs; by that great and moſt perfect Sacrifice of his, it is (he offering himſelf up by the eternal Spirit) that we now have liberty of acceſs to God. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore liberty by the blood of Jeſus,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>let us draw near,</hi> that is, let us draw near unto God in confidence of this <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in the virtue of this <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Whenever we draw near to God we muſt have reſpect to the great and eternal Sacrifice of Chriſt, and why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin ſeparates between us and God, and till ſin be removed and taken out of the way, there is no acceſs for us to God. Now it is by having recourſe to the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt that the guilt of ſin is removed, and ſo we have acceſs to God: therefore doth the Apoſtle add, <hi>Having your hearts ſprinkled from an evil conſcience.</hi> We muſt draw near to God, having our hearts ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled from an evil conſcience; we muſt firſt dip our conſciences in the blood of Chriſt, as <hi>Luthers</hi> expreſſion is, that is, get the blood of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our conſciences, look after the pardon of our ſins by the blood of Chriſt, before we can expect to have acceſs to God, or acceptance with him. This is one great part of the life of faith, to have a conſtant recourſe to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, and to make uſe of that great and eternal <hi>Sacrifice</hi>
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:99997:197"/>of the Son of God, in order to the pardon of our ſins, and our acceptance with God. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures teach us, <hi>That the juſt muſt live by faith, Rom.</hi> 1.16. Now our <hi>living by faith</hi> notes a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued courſe,</hi> living by faith is more than a ſingle act, it notes a conſtant courſe. Now wherein doth this life of faith conſiſt? Certainly one main part of the life of faith conſiſts in this, In having a conſtant recourſe to the Sacrifice and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and making uſe of that for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of our ſins, and our acceptance with God. This is very clear and evident from that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God. Paul</hi> here ſpeaks of his living by faith, <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> lived by faith, and how was it that he lived by faith? <hi>I live by the faith of the Son of God, who hath loved me, and given himſelf for me. Pauls</hi> living by faith conſiſted in this, In having reſpect to Chriſt as <hi>giving himſelf for him.</hi> Now how was it that Chriſt gave himſelf for <hi>Paul?</hi> Certainly it was in the virtue of that <hi>great and eternal Sacrifice of his:</hi> compare this with <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.2. <hi>Chriſt hath loved us, and given himſelf for us an offering and a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice unto God.</hi> So that Chriſt <hi>giving himſelf</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> was his giving himſelf an <hi>Offering</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> for him. Now <hi>Paul lived by the faith of the Son of God, who loved him and gave himſelf for him,</hi> that is, he lived by ſaith on the Sacrifice and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Chriſt, he had continual recourſe to the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, this was his living by faith. Now here it may be ſaid,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why ought we thus to live by faith on the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. How ought we to make uſe of the Sacrifice
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:99997:197"/>and Satisfaction of Chriſt ſo as to draw down the virtue and benefit of Chriſts Satisfaction to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Why ought we to make uſe of the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, and live by faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt reaſon is, Becauſe the Satisfaction of Chriſt is the only means of our Reconciliation with God. Hence is it ſaid <hi>That Chriſt hath made peace through the blood of his croſs, Col.</hi> 1.20. And <hi>We are reconciled to God by the death of his Son, Rom.</hi> 5.10. When-ever we would treat with God about terms of peace and reconciliation with him, we muſt be ſure to have recourſe to the death, ſufferings, and ſatisfaction of Chriſt; all our peace with God is founded in the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. Here are <hi>two means</hi> of our reconciliation with God ſet down, the <hi>principal</hi> and the <hi>inſtrumental.</hi> The <hi>principal</hi> means of our reconciliation with God is the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood.</hi> The <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental</hi> means of our reconciliation is our faith, <hi>Faith in his blood.</hi> That expreſſion <hi>[his blood]</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends the whole work of Chriſts <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> Chriſts <hi>laying down his life</hi> was the compleating or conſummating act of his ſufferings, and therefore all his ſufferings, in the whole work of his Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, are comprehended under that expreſſion of <hi>his blood.</hi> Chriſts Satisfaction then is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal means of our reconciliation with God. Now that which muſt make this Satisfaction of Chriſt profitable and available unto us muſt be our faith,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:99997:198"/>
                     <hi>Whom God hath ordained to be a propitiation through faith in his blood:</hi> there muſt be the <hi>acting</hi> of our faith to make Chriſts Satisfaction profitable unto us. I call it <hi>our</hi> faith, not as if ſo be faith were a <hi>work</hi> of our own, either wrought at firſt, or exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed afterwards by any power and ſtrength of our own; but I call it <hi>our faith,</hi> becauſe it is ſuch an act as is wrought in us and by us, faith it ſelf is the <hi>gift of God:</hi> ſo the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>It is not of our ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> Yet it is an act in us, and put forth by us; though God works it, yet it is ſuch a work as God works in us, not without us, we make uſe of our faculties. Faith, I ſay, is an act in us, and put forth by us, and there muſt be ſomething done in us and by us in order to our receiving benefit by Chriſts Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Chriſts Satisfaction is a work wrought without us, wrought by Chriſt himſelf in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for us, without us; yet there muſt be an act put forth in us by the help and aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, whereby we may reach forth unto and take hold of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt that is wrought without us, and without this acting of faith we cannot expect the benefit of Chriſts Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to our ſelves. The Lord expects it at our hands that we ſhould apply and betake our ſelves to the Satisfaction of his Son, before ever we be admitted into favour and reconciliation with him. This is confirmed to us by another Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>And as Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> The lifting up of the Serpent in the Wilderneſs was a Type of Chriſts being lifted up upon the Croſs. Now, ſaith our
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:99997:198"/>Saviour, whoever will have benefit by me, and would be delivered from periſhing and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he muſt direct the eye of his faith to me as crucified, he muſt behold me in my Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, there is no other means of reconciliation or peace with God but this; he that believes on me as crucified, he that looks upon me as lifted up on the Croſs to make ſatisfaction for the ſins of men, he it is that ſhall not periſh, but have eternal life: Therefore it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He determined to know nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Paul</hi> knew that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our happineſs lay in Chriſts crucifixion and ſufferings, and in the ſatisfaction that was made to God by them; therefore this was the fundamental Doctrine that he inſiſted upon: and in another place where he tells what the ſubſtance of the Goſpel is, he ſays, <hi>That God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf, not imputing to them their treſpaſſes, but imputing to them the righteouſneſs of his Son,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19, 20, &amp;c. So that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Goſpel conſiſts in this, That God offers reconciliation unto men by the death, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, and ſatisfaction of his Son. If therefore the death of Chriſt and his ſatisfaction be the only foundation of our peace with God, and the alone means of our reconciliation with him, it concerns us to make much of Chriſts ſatisfaction, and to apply our ſelves by faith unto it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſts ſufferings and ſatisfaction are the food and nouriſhment of our ſouls: Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings and ſatisfaction are the means to continue us in the love and favour of God, as well as to bring us into the love and favour of God at firſt. This is notably ſet forth by our Saviour in that
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:99997:199"/>myſterious Sermon of his in the ſixth of <hi>John,</hi> which many of his Hearers were not able to bear becauſe it was ſo ſpiritual. In that Sermon our Saviour calls himſelf the <hi>bread of life,</hi> and he tells us, <hi>The bread which he will give is his fleſh which he will give for the life of the world, verſ.</hi> 51. This Text doth plainly point out to us the work of Chriſts Satisfaction: <hi>Chriſt gives his fleſh for the life of the world,</hi> that is to ſay, he gives himſelf to ſuffer that in a part of our fleſh which he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which we ought to have ſuffered; and in this reſpect it is that he ſaith, <hi>He gives his fleſh for the life of the world,</hi> this is a plain intimation of his ſatisfaction. Now what is it that our Saviour ſaith of this work of his ſatisfaction? <hi>verſ.</hi> 55. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</hi> It is as much as if he had ſaid, My ſufferings and my ſatisfaction are the true food and nouriſhment of ſouls. Here it is that ſouls muſt repair for ſpiritual food and nouriſhment. When-ever guilt lies upon the conſcience, when the load and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſin oppreſſeth the ſoul, there is no remedy but by flying to the fleſh of Chriſt who was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and to his blood which was ſhed to make atonement for ſin. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed.</hi> Look as natural life is maintained by the conſtant uſe of our food, and taking of it in, (omit the uſe of food but for a few days, and the body is ſtarved, natural life ceaſeth) ſo the life of our ſouls is maintained by a daily living upon Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, by living upon his ſufferings and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and the reaſon is plainly this, The life of the ſoul conſiſts in the favour of God, <hi>In thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour there is life,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>and thy loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs is better than life.</hi> Without the favour of
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:99997:199"/>God there is no life, there can be no life to the ſoul; for God to frown upon the ſoul, to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt himſelf as an enemy, this is the death of the ſoul. Now it is a conſtant recourſe to the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, that is the only means to keep us in the favour of God: for it is ſin that ſeparates between God and us. Now the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt are the means to take away the guilt of ſin, <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. Therefore as we would have the life of our ſouls maintained, which conſiſts in the favour of God, and in the ſenſe of his love, we muſt have a conſtant recourſe to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt; for we cannot expect one ſmile from God out of Chriſt, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Sin doth in its own nature tend to alienate the heart of God from us. Now it is the reſpect that God hath to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of his Son (Chriſt having born that diſpleaſure, that puniſhment which we deſerved) that is the only means to turn away Gods diſpleaſure from us. Therefore is it ſaid, <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. It is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, Sin doth in its own nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline God to anger and diſpleaſure towards us, but God reſpects the ſatisfaction of his Son, he reſpects what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered, and ſo he turns away his anger, and becomes propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, kind, and ſavourable upon the account of what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for us: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it becomes us to keep the ſatisfaction of Chriſt much in our eye, becauſe this is the means of preſerving us in the favour of God as well as
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:99997:200"/>of bringing us into it at firſt. Hence are we ſaid to be <hi>preſerved in Chriſt Jeſus, Jude</hi> 1. The merit of Chriſts obedience and ſufferings is a means to preſerve us in the love of God. We might ſoon fall from the love of God, did not Chriſt preſerve us and continue us in his love by the merit of his ſatisfaction. Hence alſo are we ſaid to be <hi>ſaved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5.10. <hi>If when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life. Saved by his life,</hi> that is, continued in the love and favour of God, brought to the perfection of ſalvation. The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth that we are brought into the love and favour of God when he tells us, <hi>We were reconciled when we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</hi> therefore this expreſſion of being <hi>ſaved</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies our being <hi>kept</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> in the favour of God, and our being brought to the <hi>conſummation</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of ſalvation. <hi>We are ſaved by his life,</hi> that is, Chriſts living to make Interceſſion for us, and pleading by his Interceſſion, the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and merit of his ſufferings, this is the means to keep us in the favour of God, till we be brought to ſalvation; therefore we ought to have a conſtant recourſe to the <hi>death, ſufferings,</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, becauſe it is the means of continuing us in the love and favour of God all along, as it was to bring us into the favour of God at firſt. Hence is that expreſſion in <hi>Jude</hi> 21. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life.</hi> It is that grace and mercy which is given to us in Chriſt, through his merit and ſatisfaction, that carries us along till we are brought to eternal life,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:99997:200"/>therefore the Satisfaction of Chriſt is of conſtant Uſe to us.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. This expreſſion, <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth,</hi> may have reference and reſpect to the revelation and tender that is made of Chriſt in the Goſpel. <hi>Whom God hath propounded</hi> or <hi>ſet forth,</hi> that is, God hath propounded Chriſt and his death in the Goſpel as the means of reconciliation. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Goſpel ſaith, That <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the righteouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith, Rom.</hi> 1.17. God hath revealed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of his Son in the Goſpel as the great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our faith. Now Chriſts righteouſneſs is nothing elſe but the reſult of his obedience, active and paſſive, as it is commonly called; Chriſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that obedience to the Law which the Law requires, Chriſt ſuffering and undergoing the puniſhment which the Law exacts from us for the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:99997:201"/>breach of it, this is the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and this is that which the Goſpel tenders to us as the object of our faith, to be embraced and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, <hi>Therein,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God revealed from faith to faith:</hi> as much as if he ſhould ſay, The Goſpel reveals the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be embraced and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of us by faith on our part. Now if God do propound the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, whereof the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt are a principal part, as the great object of our faith, it concerns us then to have a conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to this, and to make uſe of it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that expreſſion is very obſervable in the Text before mentioned, The righteouſneſs of God is revealed in the Goſpel from <hi>faith to faith.</hi> Why from <hi>faith to faith?</hi> The meaning I take to be, that our faith ought to take a firm and faſt hold of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and to take a deeper rooting in it from day to day. We ſhould not be content with ſome general apprehenſions of this righteouſneſs, and that we have known a little of it; but we ſhould grow from <hi>faith to faith,</hi> our faith ſhould take deeper and firmer rooting in it continually.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the ſecond thing propounded, and that was to ſhew how we ought to make uſe of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, ſo as to draw down the virtue and benefit of it unto our own ſouls.</p>
                  <p>I take this to be an inquiry of great moment, becauſe much of the life of faith conſiſts in the right underſtanding and practice of it. I ſhall therefore propound ſeveral things by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, to ſhew how we ought to make uſe of
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:99997:202"/>the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, ſo as to draw down the benefit and virtue of it unto our own ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we would make uſe of the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Chriſt, let us look upon our ſelves as <hi>guilty perſons,</hi> moſt worthy of <hi>Divine wrath</hi> and <hi>condemnation,</hi> as conſidered in our ſelves. <hi>Satisfaction</hi> ſuppoſeth <hi>guilt,</hi> an <hi>innocent</hi> perſon need not to have any <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> made for him, an innocent perſon hath done no wrong, and therefore nothing need to be tendered for him by way of compenſation. If therefore we would have the benefit of Chriſts ſatisfaction, we muſt firſt ſee that we are guilty and condemned perſons in our ſelves. This was ſhadowed forth in the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ordinances, he that brought his offering to the Prieſt, was to lay his hand on the head of the Sacrifice, <hi>Levit.</hi> 1.4. <hi>And he ſhall put his hand upon the head of the burnt-offering, and it ſhall be accepted for him to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> This Rite of laying the hand on the head of the Sacrifice or Offering by him that brought it, did carry in it a tacit or ſecret confeſſion of the perſons guiltineſs, he did hereby confeſs that he was worthy to be put to death for his ſin. He that brought the Sacrifice by laying his hand on the head of the Sacrifice, did hereby profeſs that the beaſt ſuffered what he deſerved. That the beaſt being ſlain was an argument and token that he deſerved to be ſo dealt with himſelf, that he deſerved to be deſtroyed for his ſins: therefore when we come to make uſe of the Satisfaction of Chriſt and his Sacrifice, we ought to be ſenſible of our own guiltineſs and worthineſs of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: conſider what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. <hi>If we judge our ſelves, we ſhall not be judged of the Lord.</hi> If we would have benefit from Chriſts
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:99997:202"/>ſatisfaction, we muſt firſt judge our ſelves worthy of condemnation. Chriſts righteouſneſs and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is ſweet to none but a ſelf-condemned perſon: <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. We muſt be weary and heavy laden with the ſenſe of our own guiltineſs before we can prize the ſatisfaction of Chriſt. We ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when ever we come to make uſe of the ſatif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, to ſee what the deſert of our own ſins is in the ſufferings of Chriſt. Whatever Chriſt ſuffered, was nothing but the deſert of our ſins, it was that which we deſerved ſhould have been laid upon us. Therefore when we come to make uſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt, his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferings or his bodily ſufferings; when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider his ſoul-ſufferings, <hi>viz.</hi> his dereliction, or his being forſaken of God, the ſenſe of Gods wrath that he underwent in his ſoul; when we conſider the pain, grief, torment, and death that he ſuffered in his body, we ought to conſider with our ſelves, that theſe were the very things we deſerved, we were the perſons that deſerved to be forſaken of God, to have the face of God hid from us, we were they that deſerved to feel the wrath of God, to be made the butt of Gods wrath and diſpleaſure, we deſerved that pain, anguiſh, and death it ſelf, and all as part of the Curſe; for Chriſt ſuffered all theſe things for us, and was made a Curſe for us. So that in the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of Chriſt, as in a glaſs or mirroir, we may ſee what we deſerved; there was nothing Chriſt ſuffered but we deſerved it, and our hearts ought to be deeply ſoakt in theſe conſiderations, as ever we deſire to take in the benefit of Chriſts
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:99997:203"/>ſatisfaction. He that doth not ſee himſelf worthy to be caſt off, nay I may ſay, he that doth not ſee himſelf worthy to be cut off by the wrath of an angry God for his ſins, will never prize the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt as he ought to do. Chriſt in the work of his ſatisfaction <hi>trod the wine-preſs</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wrath; therefore it becomes us to be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, deeply ſenſible of our deſert and worthineſs of his wrath, as ever we deſire to have benefit by Chriſts ſatisfaction. Our Saviour in the ſixth of <hi>John</hi> doth at ſeveral times promiſe to us <hi>eternal life</hi> upon <hi>eating his fleſh and drinking his blood:</hi> verſ. 54. <hi>He that eats my fleſh, and drinks my blood ſhall have eternal life.</hi> Now it is a good obſervation of one: <hi>If thou wouldſt eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his blood, ſo as to have eternal life by him, do thou firſt taſte death;</hi> be ſenſible of what thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveſt by reaſon of ſin, be ſenſible of the ſpiritual death thou art ſubject to, namely ſeparation from God, obnoxiouſneſs to his wrath, which is the death of the ſoul; when once thou art ſenſible of ſpiritual death, what it is to be ſeparated from God, what it is to lye under his wrath, then thou wilt come with ſpiritual hunger and thirſt to the ſufferings of Chriſt to obtain life from him.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Direction is: If we would make uſe of the Sufferings and Satisfaction of Chriſt, ſo as to draw home the benefit of it to our ſelves, let us direct the eye of our faith unto our natures ſuffering in Chriſt. It was our nature that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and it is in our nature that ſatisfaction muſt be made, and this is the great relief unto faith to ſee ſatisfaction made in the nature of man, as ſin was committed in the nature of man. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.21. <hi>Since
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:99997:203"/>by man came death, by man alſo came the reſurrection from the dead.</hi> The Apoſtle plainly intimates, that this is the ſingular happineſs and comfort of Believers, that as happineſs was loſt at firſt in and by our nature, ſo happineſs is now recovered and reſtored in and by our nature. It was the nature of man that ſinned in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and it is the nature of man that hath obeyed and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> It was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man that was deprived of happineſs, and loſt communion with God, and was ſubject to death in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and it was the nature of man that was reſtored to happineſs, that was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto communion with God, that was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead in Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi> Therefore is it that in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.19. we read of two men, <hi>Adam</hi> and Chriſt, <hi>As by one mans diſobedience many were made ſinners. By one mans diſobedience,</hi> here is <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man. Now read the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe of the ſame Chapter, <hi>If through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, hath abounded unto many.</hi> Here we have another man, the ſecond man from Heaven, as he is called, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.47. alſo, <hi>The man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. Now the ſcope of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle is to ſhew, that as diſobedience was acted in the nature of man by <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, ſo obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was performed in the nature of man by Chriſt, who was the ſecond man from Heaven. This is a great quiet and relief to faith to find that in our nature that is adequate and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the Law, Chriſt having ſatisfied the Law in our nature for us, it is in Gods account as if we had ſatisfied it. Conſider that expreſſion,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:99997:204"/>
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.4. <hi>That the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> Some Learned men interpret that phraſe <hi>[in us]</hi> that is, in our nature, Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fulfilled the Law for us in a part of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is in Gods account as if ſo be we had ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled it. This is more fully explained to us by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews, Heb</hi> 2.11, &amp;c. <hi>For both he that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified, are all of one, for which cauſe he is not aſhamed to call them brethren.</hi> Chriſt is here ſpoken of as the Head of all the Elect. Now he is the perſon that ſanctifieth, <hi>He that ſanctifieth, and they who are ſanctified,</hi> Chriſt is the perſon ſanctifying, all the Elect are ſanctified in him. Now to ſanctifie another is to make him holy, and to preſent him holy unto God. Chriſt doth thus ſanctifie the Elect, he makes them holy, and preſents them holy to God, firſt in his own perſon; and that he may do this, that he may be in a capacity to do it, he muſt participate of one and the ſame common nature with them whom he doth ſo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie: therefore is it that the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>He that ſanctifieth, and they that are ſanctified are of one:</hi> the meaning is, they are of one and the ſame common nature, the perſon ſanctifying, and the perſons ſanctified are of one and the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nature, the head is true man, and the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are true men. This the Apoſtle doth farther amplifie at <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. <hi>For as much then as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were made partakers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of the ſame.</hi> Chriſt being the Head of the Elect, and it being his office to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them, he muſt come into their nature, and do and ſuffer that in their nature, which they ought to have done and ſuffered; they were made
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:99997:204"/>ſubject to death, therefore Chriſt taſted death for them, as we have it <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. Chriſt taking upon him the ſame nature with his brethren, did punctually fulfil for them in their nature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was expected from them. Now in the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exerciſes of faith we ought to attend this, we ought to conſider how that all the great things of our ſalvation were tranſacted by our Head in a part of our nature for us; what Chriſt ſuffered, our nature ſuffered in him.

                  </p>
                  <p>The third Direction is, We ſhould behold our nature in Chriſt ſuffering and undergoing the ſame things which we deſerved and do lye under the fear of. As it is a great relief to faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our nature ſuffering in Chriſt, ſo that which makes this relief compleat is, to ſee our nature in Chriſt ſuffering the very ſame things which we deſerved, and are under the fear of. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>The law worketh wrath.</hi> The Law works the fear of wrath in the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Law begets the ſenſe of Gods wrath in the conſcience. How ſo? The reaſon is, <hi>Becauſe by the law is the knowledge of ſin; ſin is the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the law,</hi> by the Law I know my ſelf to be a ſinner, becauſe I ſee I have tranſgreſſed ſuch a Law: now the breach of this Law <hi>worketh wrath,</hi> that is, it works the fear of wrath, as that which is due for ſin. Hence alſo is that expreſſion of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſin,</hi> Heb. 10.2. <hi>The worſhippers once pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ſhould have no more conſcience of ſin.</hi> By <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of ſin,</hi> here in this place, I take it, that we muſt underſtand a conſcience burdened and laden with the guilt of ſin. The meaning is not
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:99997:205"/>certainly, that thoſe who are once purged by the virtue of Chriſts Sacrifice, ſhould make no more conſcience of ſin; that would be an impious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, nay the contrary thereunto is moſt true, a conſcience purged from the guilt of ſin by the Blood and Sacrifice of Chriſt, ſuch a perſon makes more conſcience of ſin, that is, of committing ſin. <hi>Shall we ſin becauſe grace abounds? God forbid. The grace of God teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts.</hi> But the meaning of the place is, that thoſe who have their conſciences once pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and cleanſed by the blood of Chriſt, they ought to have no more conſcience of ſin as to guilt, that is, they ought to look upon their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences exonerated and diſcharged from guilt by the Sacrifice of Chriſt. But that which I quoted this Text for, was to ſhew that ſin brings a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of guilt. When ſin lyeth upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it fills the conſcience with the fear and horrour of Gods wrath: now the great relief to conſcience in this caſe, muſt be for a man to turn his eyes upon Chriſt, and to ſee Chriſt in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuffer that which we deſerve, and that which we are afraid of. We are afraid of Gods wrath, and Chriſt that was true man, our Head and Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty felt and ſuffered the wrath of God: we fear leſt God ſhould forſake us, leſt God ſhould caſt us off for ever, now we ought to turn our eyes upon Chriſt, and ſee our nature forſaken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in Chriſt, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Do you fear the torments of Hell, Chriſt hath born theſe very pains and torments. This is certain, there is no ſuch relief or remedy to an afflicted conſcience, as for a man to turn his eyes upon Chriſt, and to ſee Chriſt who was
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:99997:205"/>moſt innocent in himſelf ſuffering all that for us which we deſerve and fear.
<note place="margin">Deſeritur cum deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, &amp; pro natura quam aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpſerat tributum ſolvit.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt was deſerted with them who were deſerted, and paid the tribute for that nature which he aſſumed,</hi> as we heard heretofore. And another of the Ancients expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf to the ſame purpoſe: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in his righteous judgment exacted all thoſe things from us which are written in the Law, which when we our ſelves were not able to pay, our Lord hath paid them for us. Chriſt hath aſſumed and volunt arily taken upon himſelf the curſe and condemnation which we were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto;
<note place="margin">Quae pati debueramus illa ipſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulit.</note> thoſe things which we ought to have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, he himſelf hath born for us.</hi> This is a great ſupport to faith to conſider, that the things we deſerved and feared, thoſe are the things which Chriſt hath ſuffered and born for us.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Direction is this, Let us behold our nature in Chriſt voluntarily ſuffering what we deſerved to ſuffer: this alſo is a great relief to faith. As it is a relief to faith to behold our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſuffering, and ſuffering the ſame things that we ought to have ſuffered; ſo this is another great relief to faith, to behold our nature in Chriſt voluntarily ſuffering what we deſerved to ſuffer. As we who are the ſinful ſons of men, have ſinned voluntarily, ſo one of our kin, one of our ſtock and linage, one that was true man hath voluntarily offered himſelf to ſuffer for us poor ſinful men. So that ſatisfaction is voluntarily ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered up to God, in our room and ſtead, by one who was true man, <hi>and in all points like unto us, ſin only excepted.</hi> Our ſin and diſobedience was not more voluntary than Chriſts obedience and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to ſuffer for us was free and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. Chriſt our Head and Surety, when the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:99997:206"/>of God was coming forth armed againſt us, hath moſt voluntarily run to meet it, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to thoſe ſtrokes which ſhould have lighted on us. <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, thy law is in my heart, Heb.</hi> 10. The Juſtice of God was not more deſirous of ſatisfaction to be made to it, than Chriſt our Head and Surety was willing to tender it. Now if a Creditor hath never ſo great a ſum of money owing to him, and the Surety undertake the payment of the whole debt, and be moſt free and ready as to the payment of it, as free to pay the debt as the Creditor is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it, what can he deſire more? Chriſt our Surety undertook the payment of our debt, and was as ready to tender the ſatisfaction as God was to require it.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Direction is, Let us direct the eye of our faith to the perſon of the Son of God act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our nature, and ſanctifying all his ſufferings by the dignity of his own perſon. To illuſtrate this, let us conſider that Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. <hi>Such an High Prieſt became us who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, made higher than the heavens:</hi> and then it follows in <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>The Law maketh High Prieſts which have infirmity, but the word of the oath which was ſince the Law, maketh the Son who is conſecrated for evermore.</hi> The ſcope of the Apoſtle in this place is to ſhew, that he who is our High Prieſt is more than a man, he is the Son of God, <hi>The word of the oath makes the Son which is conſecrated for evermore.</hi> He oppoſeth the Son of God to the Prieſts under the Law. Now this great Perſon, who is our High Prieſt, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies his Sacrifice by the dignity of his perſon; he is the Son of God, not a meer man, as the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:99997:206"/>Prieſts were, and by the dignity of his own perſon puts the higheſt value upon the Sacrifice which he offered. Hence is that expreſſion in <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. <hi>Who needed not daily, as thoſe high Prieſts, to offer ſacrifices, firſt for their own ſins, and then for the ſins of the people; for this he did once when he offered up himſelf.</hi> Chriſts one Sacrifice was of more value than all the multitude of the Sacrifices offered by the Levitical Prieſts. Why ſo? <hi>He offered himſelf up,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. The reaſon why Chriſts Sacrifice was beyond all theirs, was becauſe he <hi>offered himſelf.</hi> Chriſt was both the Prieſt and the Sacrifice, <hi>He offered up himſelf,</hi> ſo ſaith this Text: and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. it is ſaid, <hi>That by himſelf he hath purged away our ſins.</hi> It was the Son that was the Prieſt offering, and it was the Son that was the Sacrifice that was offered. For though it were the humane nature of the Son only that was capable of ſuffering and dying; yet the perſon of the Son was conjunct with the Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the ſufferings of the humane nature. Hence is that expreſſion of <hi>Leo:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Verbo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violabili, non ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to à carn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> paſſibili.</hi> Leo.</note> The inviolable Word that is the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, who was inviolable and impaſſible, was not ſeparated from his paſſible fleſh in the time of his ſuffering.</hi> And another of the Ancients expreſſeth himſelf to this purpoſe (and it is a memorable paſſage:) <hi>The Son of God, that he might ſhew that he was not abſent from the Temple of his body in the time of his Paſſion, but that he was preſent with it in his ſuffering, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was, that as he was God, by the power of his Divinity at the ſame time when he ſuffered in his fleſh, he cauſed darkneſs to come over the Sun, brake the rocks in pieces, and raiſed the dead.</hi> So that though it was the fleſh that ſuffered, yet God was perſonally
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:99997:207"/>united to that fleſh that ſuffered. Hence is that, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered for us in the fleſh.</hi> Now we ought to turn the eye of our faith upon this great Perſon the Son of God tranſacting all in our nature. It is true, it was our nature in Chriſt that obeyed, that ſuffered, that dyed; but ſtill we ought to look upon it as influenced by the perſon of the Son of God, who aſſumed it, and did all in it and by it. The humane will in Chriſt was governed by the Divine will, yea the humane will in Chriſt was ſtrengthened and corroborated by the Divine will. In the work of Chriſts Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction the Divine nature was the principal effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe, the humane nature, the leſs princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, miniſtring or ſubſervient cauſe, as Divines ſpeak. Now this is a great relief unto faith, that Chriſt, in regard of the dignity of his Perſon, is equal to him to whom the ſatisfaction is made. For though in reſpect of his humane nature, he be inferiour to the Father, and the Father is ſaid to be <hi>greater than he, Joh.</hi> 14.28. yet in reſpect of his Divine nature he is equal with the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God:</hi> and this was the <hi>Word that took fleſh, and gave his fleſh for the life of the world. The ſame was with God in the beginning,</hi> he was with God in the ſame equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Power, Glory, and Majeſty, <hi>he was in the form of God, and counted it no robbery to be equal with God, Phil.</hi> 2.6. Now this is a great relief to faith, the perſon who tenders the ſatisfaction is of equal Power, Majeſty, and Glory with him to whom the ſatisfaction is tendered. This may greatly comfort ſuch as are diſtreſſed in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Great indeed is the perſon offended by thy
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:99997:207"/>ſins, O but great is the perſon tendering the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; the perſon offended is God, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who makes the ſatisfaction is God as well as man.

                  <p>I Come now to the ſixth Direction, which is this: If we would make uſe of the Sufferings and Satisfaction of Chriſt, ſo as to draw down the virtue and benefit of them to our own ſouls, we muſt lay the ſtreſs of our faith upon Chriſt, and rely entirely upon the virtue of that eternal Sacrifice of his. This was ſhadowed forth under the Law, in the day of atonement the Prieſt was to lay <hi>both his hands upon the head of the live-goat, Lev.</hi> 16.21. This the Prieſt was to do in the name of the people, by this ſign diſcharging them as it were, and laying all their ſins upon the beaſt, which was a figure of Chriſt. Whoever brought his Sacrifice under the Law, was to lay his hand on the head of the Sacrifice, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1.4. Now this Rite of laying the hand on the head of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as it did carry in it a tacite confeſſion of guilt, as hath formerly been ſhewn; ſo alſo there was in it a profeſſion of faith, an expectation of pardon and atonement in the virtue of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice that was to be offered up. The man that brought his offering was to lay or impoſe his hand upon it himſelf, while it was yet alive, thereby disburdening himſelf of ſin, as it were, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on the Sacrifice, and thereby teſtifying his
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:99997:208"/>faith in Chriſt the true Sacrifice that was to be ſlain for him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Chriſt calls all ſuch as are weary and heavy laden with the guilt of their ſins to come to him, and lay the burden of the guilt of their ſins on him. The Jewiſh Writers tell us, That he that did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or lay his hand on the <hi>head of the Sacrifice,</hi> was to do it with all his might, he was to lay both his hands upon the beaſts <hi>head:</hi> and what doth this teach us, but that our reliance upon Chriſt and the virtue of his eternal Sacrifice ought to be moſt firm and ſtrong? A weak and feeble hand of faith will bring but weak comfort: a ſtrong hand of faith will bring ſtrong conſolation. Therefore we muſt (as we mean to have the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Sacrifice of Chriſt) do as an holy Man,
<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal.</hi>
                     </note> and an eminent Miniſter of Chriſt did; when he came to dye he uſed theſe words, <hi>I truſt ſtrongly, ſtrongly, ſtrongly,</hi> repeating theſe words thrice. I ſay, we muſt rely ſtrongly, ſtrongly, ſtrongly upon this eternal Sacrifice of Chriſt, lay the whole ſtreſs of our Faith upon the Sacrifice and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt for pardon of ſin and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God. In the ſixth of <hi>John</hi> our Saviour annexeth the promiſe of eternal life unto eating his fleſh, <hi>verſ.</hi> 54. <hi>Whoſo eateth my fleſh, and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my blood, hath eternal life.</hi> All along in that diſcourſe of his, all the benefit that Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to us from his fleſh and blood is by eating of it, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> So in <hi>verſ.</hi> 56. <hi>He ſhall live by me.</hi> There are ſeveral great things that are promiſed to our eating the fleſh, and drinking the blood of Chriſt. And what is this
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:99997:209"/>to eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of Jeſus Chriſt? This is a metaphorical expreſſion, it is not poſſible for us to eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of Chriſt in a corporal manner; therefore <hi>to eat the fleſh, and drink the blood</hi> of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports this, to lay the whole ſtreſs of our faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt for pardon of ſin and acceptation with God.</p>
                  <p>The ſeventh Direction is: If we would make uſe of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, we muſt preſent the ſacrifice and ſatisfaction of Chriſt to God and our ſelves unto God in the virtue of it. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.10. we read, that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were to put their hands on the head of the bullock. By this Rite the Prieſt preſented the bullock, a figure of Chriſt, unto God for them, hereby intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (as <hi>Junius</hi> obſerves) that they did preſent themſelves to God not in themſelves,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Quaſi ſe ipſi ſiſterent &amp; ſacrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vae, non in ſeſe, verùm in perſona Chriſti.</hi> Junius.</note> but in the perſon of Chriſt. Our perſons are full of ſin, our duties and ſervices are mingled with a great deal of ſin; therefore we ought to preſent our ſelves to God in Chriſt who was without ſin, and his Sacrifice without the leaſt blemiſh or defilement. When ever we come to God, let us think of this, for there is a greater myſtery lyes in it than moſt are aware of: we ought to transfer our ſelves out of our ſelves, put our ſelves as it were over into Chriſt, and pray that we may not be looked upon in our ſelves, but in Chriſt. All true Believers are comprehended in Chriſt as in their Head, and what Chriſt their Head hath done in a part of their nature, which he hath aſſumed for them, is looked upon by God as if ſo be they had done it:
<note place="margin">In ipſo, non in nobis.</note> therefore are we ſaid to be <hi>the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>In him, not in our ſelves,</hi>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:99997:209"/>ſays <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Believers are righteous, but how? in their Head; they have a righteouſneſs, but what is it? not a righteouſneſs of their own, but they have a righteouſneſs in their Head, his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is accounted theirs: Believers are look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as having fulfilled the Law in Chriſt, as having born the Curſe of it in Chriſt: Believers are looked upon as having ſatisfied Divine Juſtice in Chriſt. Theſe things they could never have done in their own perſons; but for as much as Chriſt their Head hath fulfilled the righteouſneſs of the Law in their nature, it is accounted by God as if ſo be they had done it. Now in the ſolemn exerciſe of faith, it is our great concernment to preſent Chriſt our Head unto God, and to lift up his righteouſneſs before God, that is to ſay, to mind the Lord what Chriſt our Head hath done for us. It is one of the promiſes which Chriſt hath made to Believers, and it is a great promiſe, that they ſhall know that they are in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20. <hi>At that day you ſhall know that I am in the Father, and you in me, and I in you.</hi> Believers are ſaid here to be in Chriſt. How are Believers in Chriſt? Believers are in Chriſt as they are comprehended in him as their Head: Believers are in Chriſt by communion of nature, Chriſt our Head participates of our nature, and we are in him by communion of nature, we have the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and truth of humane nature in us, Chriſt hath the verity of humane nature in him, he was true man as we are. Now our nature being ſound in Chriſt, what Chriſt our Head acted for us, if we be Members of Chriſt, if we have an intereſt in him (which we have if we be true Believers) it is in Gods account as if we had acted it. <hi>You
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:99997:210"/>in me.</hi> It is as much as if our Saviour had ſaid, I do but perſonate you, I do but repreſent you, I do but act your part. <hi>You in me.</hi> Believers in Chriſt have obeyed the Law, Believers in Chriſt have undergone the curſe, Believers in Chriſt have ſuffered the wrath of God, ſatisfied Divine Juſtice; for as much as Chriſt their Head hath done all theſe things. Believers are comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chriſt, becauſe he carrying their nature, what he hath done in their nature is accounted by God as if they had done it. As God is ſaid <hi>to be in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> ſo we in Chriſt have ſatisfied Gods Juſtice. Now this is our concern to take hold of Chriſts Satisfaction by faith to preſent it unto God, and to preſent our ſelves to God in it: For although Chriſt hath taken up the nature of man, as was ſaid before, and Believers are ſaid to be in Chriſt by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of nature; yet all mankind have not ſaving benefit from Chriſt by virtue of this communion of nature that is between Chriſt and them, it is only Believers who are the Members of Chriſt that have benefit by what Chriſt hath done; therefore it is our great concernment by faith to elect and chuſe Chriſt as our Head, and having made ſuch a choice of him as our Head, then to come to God in the righteouſneſs of our Head, and to preſent the righteouſneſs of Chriſt as our Head to God for acceptance with him. If we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with Chriſt as our Head, we cannot plead his righteouſneſs; but if we have choſen Chriſt for our Head, we may come to God in the virtue of his righteouſneſs, and preſent that to God for our acceptance with him.</p>
                  <p>The eighth Direction is: After we have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:99997:210"/>and betaken our ſelves to the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, we ought in an humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to lay hold of pardon, and with humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to expect pardon and acceptance through the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt. After we have betaken our ſelves to the Satisfaction of Chriſt, and made uſe of it in a due manner, we ought to hope for pardon and acceptance in the virtue of it. To take hold of pardon before we have betaken our ſelves to the remedy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have made uſe of the means which God hath appointed for obtaining pardon, this were preſumption; therefore for any perſon to run away with this doctrine, Chriſt hath made full ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God for the ſins of men, Chriſt hath ſuffered as much as we deſerve, therefore we need not trouble our ſelves, our ſins ſhall never condemn us, this is but preſumption for any man to reaſon after this manner, until there be a ſerious application of the ſoul by faith to the Satisfaction of Chriſt for the pardon of ſin. For although there be an infinite treaſure of merit and virtue in the death and ſufferings of Chriſt to all that come to him; yet this treaſure and ſtore houſe of merit that is in the death and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt is opened unto none but unto ſuch who by humble faith apply themſelves to Chriſt for the virtue of his death. <hi>Bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled, Mat.</hi> 5.6. There muſt be then hungering and thirſting after Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before we ſhall be ſatisfied, and there muſt be faith in his blood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Him hath God ordained to be a propitiation through faith in his blood;</hi> therefore it is but preſumption for any
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:99997:211"/>man to ſay, Chriſt hath dyed and ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, therefore my ſins ſhall never condemn me, without any more ado, without troubling himſelf with any more than ſaying ſo; for what is preſumption? Preſumption is to expect the end without uſing the means. Though there be an alſufficiency in the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt to ſave as many as come to him, yet the ſatisfaction and ſufferings of Chriſt are available and effectual to none but to ſuch as by humble ſaith do apply themſelves to him, <hi>He is able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by him, Heb.</hi> 7.25. There muſt be a coming then, otherwiſe there is no ſalvation to be expected. We muſt firſt ſee the neceſſity of the Mediation and Satif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, and in an humble manner ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs our ſelves to God by faith, before we can expect benefit by his ſatisfaction; therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thou have ſeen thy periſhing condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, unleſs thou art ſenſible of the infinite need of his ſatisfaction to make thy peace with God, and doſt in an humble manner, with holy deſire apply thy ſelf to Chriſt for the virtue and benefit of his ſatisfaction, thou canſt expect no benefit by him. It is the hungring, thirſting hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoul which ſeeth his periſhing condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and thereupon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf to it, that only can expect benefit by it. But now on the other hand, after a perſon in due manner hath applied himſelf to the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, and made uſe of it by faith as the remedy which God hath appointed, it is ſo far from being preſumption in ſuch a perſon to lay hold of pardon, as that it is his duty to take hold of pardon and acceptance, and with humble
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:99997:211"/>confidence to expect it. There is an expreſs Text for this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Let us draw near with a true heart in full aſſurance of faith.</hi> The Apoſtle is here ſpeaking of the Prieſthood of Chriſt, and of the uſe we ſhould make of his eternal Sacrifice: Now, ſaith he, having pitcht our faith upon Chriſt as our Prieſt, and upon the merit and virtue of his Sacrifice, <hi>Let us draw near in full aſſurance of faith,</hi> or <hi>with full certainty of faith:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> the meaning is, having made uſe of Chriſt as our Prieſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pitcht our faith upon his Sacrifice, let us not doubt of pardon and acceptance, let us bear up our ſelves with a full confidence upon the merit of Chriſts Satisfaction. This <hi>full aſſurance of faith</hi> is, ſays a Judicious Divine, <hi>a ſetled and full per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion to be accepted through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When we have laid the ſtreſs of our faith upon the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, we ought to bear up our ſelves with an humble confidence, that we ſhall be pardoned and accepted upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the virtue and merit of Chriſts Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and not to do this, not to have a humble confidence of pardon and acceptance, after we have applied our ſelves to the Sacrifice and Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of Chriſt, would be greatly derogatory to the honour of Chriſts Satisfaction, and alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to the honour of many of Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we might not have an humble confidence of pardon and acceptance through the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, after we have applied our ſelves to it, this would be greatly deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the honour of Chriſts Satisfaction, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:99997:212"/>to the purifying of the floſh, how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience from dead work to ſerve the living God?</hi> That which the Apoſtle aſſerts here is, That the blood of Chriſt is able to purge tho conſcience from dead works ſo as to ſerve the living God. <hi>To perge the conſcience from dead works,</hi> is to purge the conſcience from the guilt of ſin, to clear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to abſolve the guilt of ſin, in the eye of conſcience, ſo that the conſcience ſhall have no more fear of guilt. Now conſider the Apoſtles argument: <hi>If the blood of bulls and goats, and the like, were able to cleanſe as to the purifying of the fleſh, how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God?</hi> The force of the Apoſtles argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment comes to this: If the Levitical Rites, if thoſe Purifications that were uſed under the Law, were ſufficient to cleanſe a perſon after a legal manner, much more is the blood of Chriſt, which is the blood of that perſon, who is God as well as man, be able to cleanſe their conſcience, who do apply themſelves by ſaith to him. The Apoſtle argues thus: They that lived under the Law had ſome purifying and cleanſing, yea ſome help as to their conſciences by the Sacrifices that were then offered; therefore much more they that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the blood of Chriſt, ſhall have benefit by virtue of his Sacrifice, which was the true Sacrifice. Under the Law, when a perſon had committed a ſin, and brought his Offering to the Prieſt, and had laid his hand on the head of the Sacrifice, and when the beaſt that was
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:99997:212"/>brought to be ſacrificed was ſlain, and the blood was put upon the Altar, there was atonement made for him, and he might know that his ſin was forgiven him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.31. <hi>The Prieſt ſhall make an atonement for him, and it ſhall be forgiven him.</hi> Now the Faithful having ſuch an expreſs promiſe, in the time of the Law, that if they came and brought their Sacrifice to the Prieſt after the due order, and did exerciſe faith on Chriſt in that Sacrifice, that their ſins ſhould be pardoned in this way; they might conclude, that when they had offered their Sacrifice according to the due order, that their ſins were pardoned and forgiven to them, for they had the promiſe and the Word of God to ſhew for it. All ſaith is grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the World. Now having a promiſe, that when they had brought their Sacrifice according to Gods appointment, they had the Word of God for it, that their ſins ſhould be pardoned. Now when Chriſt the true Sacrifice, and the end of all the other Sacrifices, hath come and offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Sacrifice for ſin, if Believers applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the virtue of his Sacrifice, ſhould not have pardon, and might not know that they are pardoned, then it would follow, that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of Believers under the Goſpel were leſs than the priviledges of the Faithful under the Law; for they might know, when they had brought their Sacrifice, that their ſins were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and if we may not know, when we apply our ſelves to the Sacrifice of Chriſt, that our ſins are pardoned, our priviledges would be leſs than theirs were. <hi>If the blood of bulls and goats</hi> have ſuch efficacy, if the <hi>legal Sacrifices</hi> be able to <hi>cleanſe the conſcience, how much more ſhall the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:99997:213"/>blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God, cleanſe our conſciences from dead works?</hi> The Apoſtle doth here oppoſe the blood of Chriſt to the blood of bulls and goats. The blood of bulls and goats, and thoſe Sacrifices that were offered under the Law, had their effect as to cleanſing perſons in a typical way; much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who was the true Sacrifice, and unto whom all the other Sacrifices were referred, have this effect to cleanſe mens conſciences really: the legal Sacrifices have their effect in a typical way, therefore the blood of Chriſt ſhall purge our conſciences really. Chriſt was God as well as man, therefore his Sacrifice doth excel all their Sacrifices; therefore doth the Apoſtle add this, <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God, cleanſe our conſciences from dead works?</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, Chriſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf up to God in the virtue of his Deity, in the virtue and power of his Divinity, the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head was conjunct with his fleſh in ſuffering: not that the Godhead ſuffered, but the Godhead was united to the humane nature when he ſuffered; therefore he that had the virtue of his Divinity to ſanctifie his Sacrifice, his ſufferings muſt needs be effectual to take away ſin; therefore not to expect pardon and atonement in the virtue of Chriſts Sacrifice and Satisfaction, when we have in an humble manner applied our ſelves to it, is to forget the dignity of the perſon who offered the Sacrifice, who was God as well as man, and did contribute the virtue of his Deity to make his Sacrifice meritorious. The Apoſtle puts a mighty weight upon this, If the Sacrifices under
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:99997:213"/>the Law were effectual to take away ſin, much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who was God as well as man, be able to purge away the guilt of ſin from the conſciences of thoſe that apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not to have an humble confidence of pardon and acceptance after we have applied our ſelves to the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to many of the Attributes of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is derogatory to the Wiſdom of God, as if he had not appointed a ſufficient Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To the Goodneſs of God, as if God had not mercy and goodneſs enough in him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and pardon ſinners, after he had received a ſull ſatisfaction for their ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is derogatory to the Truth and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, as if God would not be true and faithful to his own word, and to the proviſion which he hath made. The Sacrifice of Chriſt is the proviſion which God hath made for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of ſin, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the ſin of the world,</hi> Joh. 1.29. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. This alſo is his own word, <hi>Whom God hath ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood,</hi> Rom. 3.25. There is a Divine ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and appointment upon it, that the blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be the means of atonement; therefore if we ſhould not have atonement, when we fly for refuge to the grace that is ſet before us, the appointment and ordination of God would be in vain, we ſhould make God not to be true to his own word. Therefore after we have applied our ſelves by humble faith to the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt for pardon
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:99997:214"/>and acceptance, it is our duty to expect in an humble manner pardon and acceptance by virtue of it.</p>
                  <p>I come now to another Uſe of the Doctrine. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>4</label> Learn from what hath been opened concerning the Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction, the dignity and excellency of Chriſts Satisfaction. Chriſts Satisfaction is the moſt excellent ſatisfaction, yea there is no other ſatisfaction beſides it. Many inventions have been in the hearts of men to make ſatisfaction to God: man would fain make God ſome amends when he hath ſinned, if he knew how: there is an impreſs upon every mans heart by nature when he hath ſinned to make God amends, it is natural to man to think of ſome ſuch thing; but all the projects and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of men in this kind and to this end have been in vain and fruſtrate: whatever men have invented, thinking by it to pacifie God, and make fatisfaction to him for the ſins they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, hath been to no purpoſe. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways which the ſons of men have thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make ſatisfaction to God by. 1. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by afflicting the body, exerciſing ſeverities upon it: the Papiſts think to make ſatisfaction to God this way, by macerating the body, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſh, injoyning Penances, Pilgrimages, and Tortures upon themſelves, thinking to ſatisfie God hereby. 2. Sometimes men think to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God by coſtly Sacrifices: thus the Heathens thought to ſatisfie their Gods by their Heca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tombs, the multitude of their Sacrifices, and thoſe moſt pompous, coſtly, rich, magnificent Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Men have thought to make ſatisfaction to
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:99997:214"/>God by ſome reformation of their converſations, by living a more ſtrict and auſtere life than they did formerly. A ſtrict life is good in it ſelf, and none can be ſaved without it; but yet it is too ſhort to ſatisfie God. However this is the courſe ſome have taken when conſcience hath been awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened, and they ſee the hainouſneſs of their ſins, they think to ſatisfie God by a ſtrict life, they renounce the world, ſpend their time in retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, abridge themſelves of their delights and pleaſures, and live by ſuch and ſuch rules. Theſe and many more ways have men invented to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie God withal. But it is a true ſpeech of a moderate Papiſt: <hi>Whatſoever was not God,
<note place="margin">Quicquid Deus non eſt, non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerit ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere.</note> was not ſufficient to ſatisfie God.</hi> All thoſe ways that have been deviſed by men, are too ſhort to make ſatisfaction to the great God; and if we ſummon our ſelves to God Tribunal, and think with our ſelves how juſt and holy he is, we ſhall ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend his Juſtice will not be put off with ſuch poor things as men bring to him to ſatisfie him withal, nothing leſs than God can ſatisfie God. The ſatisfaction of Chriſt is the ſatisfaction of that perſon who is God as well as man, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it had not been available: and herein did the excellency of Chriſts Satisfaction appear, that it was abundantly ſufficient. The dignity and excellency of Chriſts Satisfaction may yet farther appear from theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſts Satisfaction was once made, and but once: the Sacrifice was but one, and the Satisfaction made by it but one. The Sacrifices under the Law were many. The Sacrifices offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Heathen were many; but Chriſts Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was but one, and offered once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi>
                     <pb n="412" facs="tcp:99997:215"/>10.14. <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> Heb. 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified through the offering up the body of Chriſt once for all, once only.</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> The Greek word hath a great force in it, as Learned men obſerve. It ſignifies, that what was once done was ſo perfect and compleat, that it was not neceſſary it ſhould be done again, nay that it was impious to repeat it. Chriſts one Sacrifice comprehended the virtue of all other Sacrifices in it. All the Sacrifices that were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by men in all Ages, both by Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, were a plain intimation, that there was ſome Sacrifice by which God muſt be pacified, and that men had an apprehenſion that God could be pacified no other way. Now Chriſts Sacrifice was the true Sacrifice: that which the world aimed at, but could never attain, was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained only by the Sacrifice of Chriſt: that which the world would fain have been at and attained, was to pacifie God: now this could never be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed any other way but by the Sacrifice of the Son of God. Chriſts Sacrifice was but one, and yet by that one Sacrifice he hath for ever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected them that are ſanctified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Satisfaction of Chriſt was perfect and compleat, there was nothing wanting in it of what was neceſſary to make it compleat.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The perſon who offers it was moſt holy, and without ſin, <hi>Such an high Prieſt became us who was holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> Heb. 7.26. The Prieſts under the Law were to offer Sacrifices, firſt for their own ſins, then for the ſins of the people, but Chriſt needed none of this,
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:99997:215"/>for Chriſt had no ſin; therefore he that was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſin in himſelf, was moſt fit to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſins of others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the perſon himſelf that offered the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was moſt perfect and compleat, ſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice it ſelf was moſt perfect and compleat, and that appears by the effect of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.14. <hi>By one offering hath he perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi> If the Offering and Sacrifice of Chriſt had not been moſt perfect in it ſelf, it could never have perfected others. For this is a ſure rule, That the effect cannot riſe higher than the cauſe; therefore if Chriſts Offering had not been perfect in it ſelf, it could not have perfected others. But now, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he hath perfected, and for ever perfected them that are ſanctified,</hi> that is, Chriſt by his Sacrifice hath perfectly reconciled us to God. There need be no more done to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile a perſon to God than what Chriſt hath done. Now if the Sacrifice and Satisfaction of Chriſt hath that virtue and efficacy in it as to bring us into perfect reconciliation with God, ſo as that there is no danger of loſing it, nor falling from it, then it is a perfect and compleat ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. This ſhews us the dignity and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Chriſts Satisfaction, therefore we ought to have an high eſteem of it, and be ſo much the more incouraged to make uſe of it.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>3</label> The Satisfaction of Chriſt was adequate and commenſurate to what the Law and Divine Juſtice did require. All that the Law could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire was the death of the ſinner, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt, thou ſhalt dye the death,</hi> thou ſhalt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo a double death, death natural, and death ſupernatural. Now Chriſt in the work of his Satisfaction hath undergone both theſe deaths, he hath undergone natural death and ſupernatural death. All that Divine Juſtice could require was, that the ſinner ſhould undergo the utmoſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the nature of man was capable of: now the ſufferings of Chriſt were conſummate, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the higheſt meaſure and degree, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the humane nature ſupported by the Deity could ſuffer, that our Saviour did undergo; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſatisfaction was adequate and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurate to the Law and Divine Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We may ſee the dignity and excellency of Chriſts Satisfaction in this, That the Satisfaction of Chriſt in ſome reſpect was more than ſufficient. Chriſt in reſpect of ſome circumſtances attending his ſatisfaction, hath paid and given more than
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:99997:216"/>the Law required; for it is well obſerved by a Learned man, The Law did not require that God ſhould dye, the Law required that man ſinning, man ſhould dye; but now the perſon dying and ſatisfying for us, was God as well as man, <hi>God hath redeemed the Church with his own blood, Act.</hi> 20.28. Neither (1) did the Law require that any perſon ſhould dye but for his own proper ſin. The language of the Law is, <hi>The ſoul that ſins ſhall dye.</hi> Now every ſoul was to <hi>bear his own iniquity.</hi> Neither (2) did the Law require ſuch a death that ſhould be of ſo great efficacy, that it ſhould not be only able to aboliſh death, but alſo be able to introduce life, and that a life far more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than that terrene and earthly life which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt. In theſe reſpects the Satisfaction of Chriſt was more than ſufficient; and therefore one of the Ancients hath this expreſſion: <hi>Chriſt hath paid for us much more than we owed, and ſo much the more was that which Chriſt paid, by how much the vaſt and immenſe Ocean excels the leaſt drop.</hi> Let us learn then to have high thoughts of the dignity and excellency of Chriſts Satisfaction; this will be of marvellous uſe to us, when we are under troubles and conflicts of conſcience for ſin. Though our ſins are great, exceeding great, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in themſelves, yet being compared with the infiniteneſs of Chriſts Satisfaction, they are ſwallowed up in the vaſtneſs and inſiniteneſs of the merit of the ſufferings of that perſon who was God as well as man.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The excellency of Chriſts Satisfaction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, In that the Sacrifice of Chriſt is an eternal Sacrifice, that is, the virtue and efficacy of Chriſts Sacrifice and Satisfaction is eternal.
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:99997:217"/>Chriſts Sacrifice is but one, and that once offered, and yet the virtue of it is eternal. The repetition of the Sacrifices under the Law did ſhew the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of thoſe Sacrifices; for if one Sacrifice had been ſufficient, what need of ſuch a multitude of Sacrifices, and thoſe ſo frequently repeated? Now the Sacrifice of Chriſt is but one, and it was not neceſſary that it ſhould be repeated; for though it was but <hi>once offered,</hi> yet the virtue of it is eternal. It is a great expreſſion of the Apoſtle ſpeaking of this Sacrifice, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Chriſt by the eternal Spirit offered himſelf up without ſpot to God.</hi> Chriſt offered himſelf up to God by the <hi>eternal Spirit,</hi> that is, he offered himſelf up to God in the virtue of his eternal Deity: the Son of God, who offered himſelf up as a Sacrifice to God in our nature, being an eternal perſon, hath put eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal virtue and efficacy into that Sacrifice of his. Such was the dignity of Chriſts perſon, that he being the eternal Son of God, the virtue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his Sacrifice, which was once offered, and that now in the end of the world, doth yet extend it ſelf to all ages of the world, thoſe that are paſt as well as thoſe that are to come; <hi>For Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. The Sacrifice of Chriſt is eternal for as much as the virtue and efficacy of it is eternal, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf to all ages. Hence alſo is Chriſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the new and living way, Heb.</hi> 10.20. That expreſſion which we tranſlate <hi>new,</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> properly ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that which was <hi>newly killed</hi> or <hi>newly ſlain:</hi> the virtue of Chriſts blood is ſuch in Gods account, as if Chriſt were juſt now crucified, his blood is always freſh, the vigour and efficacy of it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains as if it were but newly ſhed. What a
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:99997:217"/>mighty incouragement may this be to us, to come and make uſe of the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, ſince the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt are as freſh in Gods account, as if Chriſt had juſt now undergone them, as if he were but newly come down from the Croſs; and God is as much pleaſed and ſatisfied in them, as if Chriſt had but newly undergone them.</p>
                  <p>There is one Uſe more to be made of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>5</label> Let us learn from the Doctrine of Chriſts Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, why the contempt of the Goſpel is ſo great a ſin, and why it is that God puniſheth the contempt of the Goſpel ſo ſeverely: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the contempt of the Goſpel is ſo great a ſin is, becauſe it is a contempt of the ſufferings of Chriſt: and the reaſon why God puniſheth the contempt of the Goſpel ſo ſeverely is, becauſe it is a contempt of the great Sacrifice that was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſin. There hath been a great impreſſion on the hearts of men in all Ages, That God was to be pacified by ſacrifice, hence it is that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have offered ſacrifices, and hereby the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe of mankind hath been expreſt, that God was to be pacified by ſome ſacrifice. Now when the true, the great, the only ſacrifice hath been offered up, which is the death of Chriſt, and the virtue of this ſacrifice (which was to pacifie and atone God) publiſhed and declared in the Goſpel, and men do yet contemn this ſacrifice and him that hath offered it; certainly this muſt needs make the ſin of the world exceeding great; and the reaſon is, becauſe that this is a plain evidence, that men do not value reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation with God. When God hath provided
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:99997:218"/>a ſacrifice, by which he will be atoned and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to men, and they deſpiſe this ſacrifice, and undervalue this way of reconciliation, 'tis a plain ſign and evidence that men do not care for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, it is all one to them, if they continue in open hoſtility againſt him. The ſlighting of Chriſt, and neglect of grace offered by the Redeemer, is a plain contempt of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty, it is a clear ſign that men do not regard Gods anger, neither are they afraid of his wrath: For if men were afraid of Gods anger, and terrified at the apprehenſions of his wrath, they would ſeek after reconciliation with God. Now nothing doth aggravate ſin more than when there is a plain and manifeſt contempt of God, and this there is in the refuſing of reconciliation with him. God offers reconciliation to men by a Redeemer, they neglect it, they reject it, this is a manifeſt contempt of God: and hence it is, that God puniſheth the contempt of the Goſpel ſo ſeverely. I ſhall illuſtrate this by ſeveral Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.1, &amp;c. <hi>The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain King, which made a marriage for his ſon, and he ſent forth his ſervants to call them that were bidden to the wedding, and they would not come. Again he ſent forth other ſervants, ſaying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready, come unto the marriage. But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandiſe, and the remnant took his ſervants, and intreated them ſpightfully, and ſlew them. But when the King heard thereof he was wroth, and he ſent forth his armies, and deſtroyed thoſe murtherers, and burnt up their city. A certain
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:99997:218"/>King made a marriage for his ſon.</hi> God hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Son to our nature, God hath ſent his Son into our nature, and the Son of God hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried our nature to himſelf, by joyning it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the bond of perſonal union. Upon this marriage, the joyning of our nature to the Son of God, God makes a Feaſt, a Marriage-feaſt, and in that Feaſt he prepares all good things for the ſons of men, he offers righteouſneſs, life, ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and all good things whatſoever in his Son; and God by his Ambaſſadours, the Goſpel-Miniſters invites them to partake of theſe good things. <hi>He ſent forth his ſervants to call them that were bidden to the wedding.</hi> When God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared this Feaſt of all good things in his Son, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Treaſures of his Grace in Chriſt; when he had ſet open the Treaſure of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for mens Juſtification, and the alſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Grace for Sanctification, then he ſends his Ambaſſadours and Miniſters to invite men to come and partake of all this grace. But how is it that men entertain theſe offers of grace and good things made to them in Chriſt? read <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>They made light of it, and went their ways, one 18 his farm, another to his merchandiſe.</hi> O but mark the iſſue, how doth God take this flighting of his grace, rejecting of his Son, and deſpiſing of the marriage-feaſt? read <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. <hi>When the King heard of this, he was wroth, and he ſent forth his armies, and deſtroyed thoſe murtherers, and burnt up their city.</hi> This was the revenge which God took for his deſpiſed and rejected grace. He ſent the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Romans, burnt up <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Nation of the Jews, to whom Chriſt and the Goſpel was firſt ſent. That the Son of God,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:99997:219"/>who was God bleſſed for ever, ſhould come from Heaven in perſon, that he ſhould take to himſelf the nature of man, and do and ſuffer ſuch things for man, in the nature of man, and yet be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and rejected by men, this makes the ſin of men very great. In <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. our Saviour tells us, That <hi>he was the living bread that came down from heaven, and the bread which he would give was his fleſh, which he would give for the life of the world. I am the living bread which came down from heaven.</hi> The Son of God, who was life, happineſs, ſalvation, and all good things, came down into our nature, aſſumed a part of our fleſh, and gave that fleſh for the life of the world. Now when the Son of God himſelf (ſo great a perſon) and all his ſufferings ſhall be contemned and deſpiſed, this muſt needs be great ſin. This is more fully explained to us in another Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26, 27, 28, 29, 30. <hi>For if we ſin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which ſhall devour the adverſaries. He that deſpiſed Moſes law dyed without mercy, under two or three witneſſes. Of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of grace; for we know him that ſaid, Vengeance belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto me, I will recompenſe, ſaith the Lord. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> The ſcope of the Apoſtle is to ſhew how ſeverely God puniſheth the contemners and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſers of Goſpel-grace. The ſin of ſuch who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the Goſpel, and reject the grace of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:99997:219"/>in this, That they neglect and contemn the great Sacrifice that was offered for ſin, that is plainly implied in that expreſſion when it is ſaid, <hi>There remains no more ſacrifice for ſin. If we ſin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more ſacrifice for ſin.</hi> It is as much as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, There was a ſacrifice for ſin, there was a ſacrifice appointed, there was a means to pacifie and atone God, namely, the death of his Son. But they that neglect and reject the grace of the Goſpel, they contemn this ſacrifice, this great and only ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; they contemn the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, by which they might have peace with God. Now let us conſider, what is the ſentence that is paſſed upon ſuch? What is like to become of ſuch who thus contemn the Goſpel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the grace of it, who contemn the great and only ſacrifice? That which is reſerved for ſuch is this, <hi>It is judgment and fiery indignation which ſhall devour the adverſaries. If we ſin wilfully, after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains no more ſacrifice for ſin, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation which ſhall devour the adverſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, God accounts ſuch adverſaries as perſiſt and continue in ſin, after the offer and tender of grace to them. God would be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to men, but they will not be reconciled to him; therefore they are adverſaries, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in open hoſtility againſt God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is judgment reſerved for ſuch, a certain and fearful looking for of judgment. God will judge them according to their deſerts, he will execute judgment upon them according to
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:99997:220"/>their demerit; and that we may fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this,

And then the Apoſtle goes on to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this in <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, 29. <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes law dyed without mercy under two or three witneſſes. Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye, ſhall he be thought worthy, who tramples under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of grace?</hi> The force of his argument comes to this: He that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was puniſhed, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that deſpiſeth the Goſpel ſhall be much more puniſhed, <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes law dyed without mercy.</hi> Why doth the Apoſtle call it <hi>Moſes Law?</hi> That which was called <hi>Moſes</hi> Law was indeed the Law of God, <hi>Moſes</hi> was only the Miniſter to whom and by whom it was delivered, but the Law was God's. But <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſet here in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Chriſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Miniſter and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant only; but Chriſt was more than a Miniſter and a Servant, Chriſt was the Son of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Of how much ſorer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, who trod under foot the Son of God?</hi> Here lies the force of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: If God did not ſuffer the tranſgreſſours of the Law which was publiſhed by <hi>Moſes</hi> a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Servant, to go unpuniſhed, much leſs will he ſuffer the rejection of the Goſpel which was publiſhed by his own Son, that came out of his boſom, to go unpuniſhed. <hi>The Law came by Maſes, but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:99997:220"/>Joh.</hi> 1.17. But this is not all, the Doctrine of the Goſpel hath not only a more excellent Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher than the Law, which is the Son of God, whereas <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Miniſter and Servant only; but there is ſomething more in it, the matter publiſhed, and the great object of ſaith propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, is the Son of God himſelf; that expreſſion, <hi>Who hath trampled under foot the Son of God,</hi> doth not only intimate, that Chriſt the Son of God is the Publiſher of the Goſpel; but it alſo intimates the great ſin of them who reject the Goſpel, in that they reject ſo excellent a Perſon as the Son of God is, who is the ſubject matter of the Goſpel. Compare this with other Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Separate unto the Goſpel of God concerning his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> The great thing which the Goſpel reveals is the Son of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19. <hi>The Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt, who preached among you by us.</hi> The Goſpel then is the revelation of the Son of God. Now that ſo great and excellent a Perſon as the Son of God and God, ſhould be rejected, this is that which makes the ſins of the deſpiſers and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Goſpel to be ſo great. Now as that is one thing that aggravates the ſin of them that reject the grace of the Goſpel, that they contemn Chriſts perſon, <hi>they tread under foot the Son of God;</hi> ſo another thing is, they contemn his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, <hi>they count the blood of the Covenant where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are ſanctified an unholy thing:</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, ſuch as deſpiſe the Goſpel deſpiſe the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and ſufferings of Chriſt which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and made known to them in the Goſpel; they make the ſufferings of Chriſt to be no other than the ſufferings of a common or an
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:99997:221"/>ordinary man; they put no difference between Chriſts ſufferings and another mans ſufferings, this is impious and horrid indeed. The Son of God and God, the Creator of all things, becomes man for man, and when he is ſo, gives his life, ſheds his blood for men; and after all this love and condeſcenſion, his ſufferings are counted no more but as the ſufferings of an ordinary man: Is this a little thing that God ſhould aſſume fleſh, and give that fleſh to be crucified, in love to men, for their Redemption, and that his ſufferings ſhould be counted no more than as the ſufferings of an ordinary common man? Is this an ordinary ſin? Bluſh O Heavens, and be aſtoniſhed O Earth! <hi>They counted it an unholy thing.</hi>

                        </gap>.</note> To make the ſufferings of that perſon who was God as well man, to be no more than the ſufferings of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon, this is to make the ſufferings of Chriſt a profane or common thing. The Apoſtle aggravates this ſin yet further, and calls it, <hi>A doing deſpite to the Spirit of grace;</hi> but I ſhall not farther inſiſt upon that. In the next place the Apoſtle doth amplifie yet farther the judgment upon them that reject the grace of the Goſpel: <hi>We know him that hath ſaid, Vengeance is mine, and I will recompenſe, ſaith the Lord. And again, the Lord ſhall judge his people. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here are two things affirmed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God will certainly avenge the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and rejection of the Goſpel, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will recompenſe, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the revenge God takes on Goſpel-rejecters, is moſt dreadful, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> There is much implied in this ſentence.</p>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:99997:221"/>
                  <p n="1">1. That when God takes Goſpel-ſinners into his hand to puniſh them, his judgments on them are moſt terrible. The judgments which God brings for abuſing the Goſpel and the grace of it, are not common, ordinary judgments, no, they are ſtupendious and amazing judgments, <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> When God comes to take a people in hand, and to call them to account, how they have carried it towards his grace, and behaved themſelves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Goſpel which he hath ſent to them for a long time, he will deal with them to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. We have had too ſad inſtances of this, witneſs the deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where there was not a ſtone left upon a ſtone: witneſs the two laſt great Judgments upon the great City of our own Land that were ſucceſſive one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Plague and Fire, which were unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled Judgments, the like never known in our days, nor in the days of our Fathers, no nor ſince it was a Nation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is alſo implied in it, That when God takes in hand, and begins to puniſh Goſpel-ſinners, ſuch as have deſpiſed his grace, he doth not ſoon make an end with them. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> As much as if it had been ſaid, When God hath once taken men into his hand to puniſh them, he doth not ſo ſoon make an end with them, he is a living God, and hath time enough before him (to ſpeak after the manner of men) to avenge himſelf upon his adverſaries. God is the living God, he lives this year, and the next year, and he hath various ways, and various ſeaſons to avenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on ſuch as do reject his grace. God doth not
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:99997:222"/>pour out all his wrath in one Judgment upon them that contemn his Son, and reject the grace offered by them, but he ſends variety of Judgments on them, and if they will not underſtand his wrath by one Judgment, they ſhall be forced to underſtand it by variety of Judgments. <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> God lives to right himſelf, to avenge the quarrel of his ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, abuſed grace and Goſpel. It is much to be feared, that we are fallen under the influences and effects of this Scripture. Truly the Lord ſeems to be calling the Churches of the Gentiles to an account for their behaviour and carriage under the Goſpel, as he hath the Jews before us. Let us conſider that Text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.22. <hi>Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God: on them which fell ſeverity; but towards thee goodneſs, if thou continue in his goodneſs, otherwiſe thou alſo ſhalt be cut off.</hi> Here the Lord doth plainly threaten the Churches of the Gentiles, that if they abuſe his grace, as the Jews have done, they ſhall be cut off by his Judgments, as the Jews were; and if we conſider what God hath done and is doing in the world, have we not reaſon to fear and tremble, hath not Judgment began at the houſe of God? And have not they which make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt in oppoſition to Antichriſt, been the ſubjects of Gods Judgments. Let us conſider one Scripture more, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. at the latter end of that Chapter, it is a Prophecy of the times wherein we are fallen. <hi>I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one ſate like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a ſharp ſickle. And another Angel came out of the Temple, crying with a lond voice to him
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:99997:222"/>that ſate on the cloud, Thruſt in thy ſickle and reap, for the time is come for thee to reap, for the harveſt of the earth is ripe. And he that ſate on the cloud thruſt in his ſickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. And another Angel came out of the Temple which is in Heaven, he alſo having a ſharp ſickle. And another Angel came out from the Altar, which had power over fire, and cryed with a loud cry to him that had the ſharp ſickle, ſaying, Thruſt in thy ſickle, and gather the cluſters of the vine of the earth, for her grapes are fully ripe. And the Angel thruſt in his ſickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and caſt it into the great wine-preſs of the wrath of God. And the wine preſs was trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den without the city, and blood came out of the wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, even unto the horſes bridles by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſix hundred furlongs.</hi> It is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, theſe two Angels which come out with their ſickles to reap down the world with great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, come not until after the Promulgation of the Goſpel, which was made to the world by the three Angels, which we read of in the beginning of this Chapter. When God had ſent the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the world, and offered reformation to it, and the world did not obey the Goſpel, nor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the reformation offered to it, then God ſent theſe two Angels to reap down the world with his Judgments.
<note place="margin">Cluverus <hi>in Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyp.</hi>
                     </note> It is the opinion of a Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, that this Prophecy concerns the times of Reformation, when light had been offered to the world, and the world grew wicked after light and reformation was offered to it. Now that which is obſervable in the ſecond Angels Commiſſion is, That he ſhould thruſt in his ſickle and gather the cluſter of the vine of the earth,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:99997:223"/>
                     <hi>And the Angel thruſt in his ſickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth.</hi> Now this expreſſion of the <hi>Vine,</hi> when it is taken myſtically, doth uſually in Scripture ſignifie the Church of God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.21. <hi>I have planted thee a choice vine.</hi> And ſo in that paſſage of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Behold and viſit this thy vine.</hi> The Church is compared to a Vine frequently in Scripture. Now the Angel is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to gather the vine of the earth; ſo that the Judgment here Spoken of, is ſuch a Judgment as did concern the Church, at leaſt the people that do profeſs themſelves to be the Church. The Reformed Churches which were planted at the firſt, as a choice Vine, with purity of Doctrine, and more integrity of manners, being degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their firſt purity, and bringing forth wild grapes of corrupt Doctrine and evil man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, God ſends his Angel with his ſickle to cut down the cluſter of this Vine. And that which doth confirm this interpretation is this, That the wine preſs is to be trodden without the City, the City in the <hi>Revelations</hi> is <hi>Babylon, the Mother of Harlots and abomination of the earth.</hi> Now the wine-preſs was trodden without the City, and <hi>blood came out of the wine-preſs, even to the horſes bridles.</hi> So that the Judgment here ſpoken of doth not reach <hi>Babylon, Rome</hi> which is myſtical <hi>Babylon;</hi> God hath his time when he will viſit her, he hath reſerved a more fore Judgment for her; but the Judgment that is here ſpoken of, is a Judgment that reaches the Proteſtant Churches, they are the Vine of the Earth, the true Church by profeſſion; but not living up to their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, God puniſheth them for their ſinful and profane lives: and the Judgment which God
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:99997:223"/>executes upon theſe, is no ſmall Judgment. We read here of <hi>blood coming out to the horſes bridles.</hi> Which notes the copiouſneſs and abundance of bloodſhed which ſhall be at the time of the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this Judgment. The Lord grant that we may not ſee this Scripture more and more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. I have been apt to think, that the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which the Sword hath already made, hath been in part a fulfilling of this Scripture, and O that we could ſay, that the force of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the ſtrength of that Judgment which flows from it, were already ſpent and exhauſted; but may not we yet fear, that this Prophecy may bring forth more wrath and judgment upon us than yet we have ſeen? If any thing prevent the farther effuſion of blood (which we read of here in this Scripture) and that great wrath here threatened, it muſt be humble, hearty, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate crys to Heaven, faith in the blood of Chriſt with the through reformation of our lives; for otherwiſe there ſeems to be great wrath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt us; therefore let us make this uſe of it, to cry heartily to God, let us endeavour to ſtand between the living and the dead, to divert, if it be poſſible, that wrath which yet hangs over our heads.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THere have been two Obſervations that have been propounded out of this Verſe.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>1</label>
                     <hi>That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath laid down his life for his people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond was, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>2</label>
                     <hi>That the love of Chriſt in laying down his life for us, was the higheſt expreſſion or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his love. Greater love than this hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the former Point I have had occaſion to open the nature of Chriſts ſufferings, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold (as I was able) the great Doctrine of Chriſts Satisfaction: that which I am now to do in this latter Point is, to ſhew the greatneſs of the love of Chriſt in his ſuffering, and in the work of his Satisfaction; for here lies the ſtreſs of the Text, to ſhew that the love of Chriſt was eminently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the work of his Satisfaction: <hi>Greater love than this,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>hath no man, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> Chriſts lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his life for us, was the moſt eminent expreſſion of his love to us. The Scripture, when it ſpeaks of the love of Chriſt, it ſpeaks of the <hi>heights and depths, lengths and breadths of the love of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:99997:224"/>
                  <p>Now there are five things eſpecially wherein theſe <hi>heights and depths, and lengths and breadths of Chriſts love</hi> are eminently to be ſeen, and they are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His <hi>Incarnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. His ſubjection to the <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The work of his <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The work of his <hi>Interceſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. His <hi>Headſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now having already ſpoken of the <hi>Love of Chriſt in his Incarnation,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Love of Chriſt in his being made under the Law,</hi> I come to ſhew how the love of Chriſt doth manifeſt it ſelf, and is to be ſeen in the work of his Satisfaction. It is very obſervable, that the Scripture, when it ſpeaks of the love of Chriſt, lays the ſtreſs here; it ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us the love of Chriſt in his ſufferings, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſufferings of Chriſt to be the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Chriſts love to us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, an offering and ſacrifice to God, for a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour.</hi> So at the 25. verſe of that Chapter, <hi>Even as Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> Chriſt giving himſelf for the Church, that is, giving himſelf to ſuffer for it, this was the great inſtance of his love: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Who hath loved me, and given himſelf for me.</hi> Rev. 1.5. <hi>To him that hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.12. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us, becauſe we thus judge, that if one dyed for all, then were all dead.</hi> 1 Joh. 4.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us.</hi> Still we ſee when the Scripture ſpeaks of the love of Chriſt, it expreſſeth it by what he ſuffered for us. Now the greatneſs of Chriſts love, the heights and depths, and lengths
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:99997:225"/>and breadths of Chriſts love in his ſufferings, and in the work of his Satisfaction may be illuſtrated by ſeveral Particulars. And I ſhall propound ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things for the clearing up of this truth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the ſufferings of Chriſt were the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of his humiliation. The Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſts Exinanition or emptying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> ſo we tranſlate it: the word in the Original is, <hi>he emptyed himſelf out of all,
<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>Ex omni ſeipſum ad nihilum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſit.</hi> Tertul.</note> he reduced himſelf to nothing.</hi> One of the Ancients renders the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>he exhauſted himſelf.</hi> Now this Exinanition or emptying of the Son of God was his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary laying aſide of his own glory as to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, and alſo his ſubjecting himſelf to the loweſt abaſement for our ſakes. The Son of God did not, could not diveſt himſelf of his eſſential glory: he did not ceaſe to be the Son of God and God in the loweſt ſtate of his humiliation; but he did ſtrip and diveſt himſelf of his manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive glory: he was content not to appear to be what indeed he was, and he ſubmitted-himſelf to the loweſt abaſement for our ſakes. Now there were two parts of Chriſts Exinanition or empty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was his Incarnation, his aſſumption of our nature.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond was his ſuffering death for us, and the Apoſtle ſpeaks of both theſe in this place.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of Chriſts Exinanition was his Incarnation, <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation,</hi> or <hi>emptied himſelf.</hi> How ſo? <hi>He took upon him the form of a ſervant, he was in the form of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant.</hi> That he who
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:99997:225"/>was in the <hi>form of God</hi> ſhould take upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> this was emptying himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. That the eternal God ſhould become a mortal man, this was great humiliation indeed, <hi>He was in the form of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and yet he was made in the likeneſs of men, and was found in faſhion as a man.</hi> Theſe expreſſions muſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly be underſtood: we muſt not underſtand them as ſome ancient Hereticks did, that Chriſt only had a fantaſtical body, that is, the ſhew and appearance of a body, becauſe it is ſaid here the <hi>likeneſs of men,</hi> and that he was <hi>found in faſhion as a man.</hi> I ſay we muſt not underſtand them as if Chriſt only had a fantaſtical body, not a true and a real body; for the Scripture tells us plainly, That Chriſt was made of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi> and he was in all things <hi>made like unto us, ſin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.</hi> And it is a true expreſſion that of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>That which was not aſſumed was not healed.</hi> If the Son of God had not had the verity of humane nature in him, humane nature could never have been reſtored. If he had not aſſumed a true humane ſoul and a true humane body, our fouls and bodies which were tainted with original ſin, could never have been recovered; therefore when it is ſaid, <hi>He was made in the likeneſs of men, and found in faſhion as a man,</hi> we muſt not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, as if Chriſt had the likeneſs of a humane body, and not a true humane body; but theſe expreſſions, <hi>Made in the likeneſs of men, and found in faſhion as a man,</hi> not only ſet forth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his humiliation and condeſcenſion, that he that was <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> that he who was ſo far above men, did yet take to himſelf the common nature of men, <hi>He was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:99997:226"/>of men, and found in faſhion as a man.</hi> The plain meaning ſeems to be, That the Son of God taking our nature, appeared among men, as to his external viſage and appearance as another man, as one like the reſt of men. It is true, ſpiritual eyes could behold the beams of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity breaking through the veil of his fleſh: <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory as the glory of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth.</hi> The Apoſtles and other Believers, who ſaw Chriſt in the days of his fleſh, with ſpiritual eyes and hearts that were given to them, could ſee the beams of the Divinity breaking through his Humanity, they could ſee ſomething more than a man in him. But look upon him as to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal form and habit, and ſo he appeared to the generality of men like one of the reſt of men, he was wrapt up in ſwadling cloaths, laid in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he was ſubject to his Parents, he did hunger and thirſt, and eat and drink, and he was ſubject to the ſame common infirmities with other men; and therefore doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>He was made in the likeneſs of men, and found in faſhionas a man,</hi> that is, as to his external form and habit he ſeemed to be like to the common ſort of men. Hence are thoſe expreſſions of the Prophet, <hi>He was as a root out of a dry ground, He hath no form nor comelineſs, and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him, Iſa.</hi> 53.2. This is the firſt part of Chriſts humiliation,
<note place="margin">Creator ac Dominus omnium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum unus voluit eſſe mortalium.</note> that he who was in the <hi>form of God</hi> ſhould yet take to himſelf the <hi>form of a ſervant. He that was the Creator and Lord of all things</hi> (as <hi>Leo</hi> expreſſeth it) <hi>would yet become one of mortal men: and he that
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:99997:226"/>abiding in the form of God, did alſo make man himſelf, the very ſame perſon taking on him the form of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant himſelf is made man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond part of Chriſts Exinanition or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptying himſelf, was his ſubjecting himſelf to death for us. This is that which the Apoſtle takes particular notice of in the Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He humbled himſelf:</hi> and how did he humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? <hi>He humbled himſelf, and became obedient to the death, even the death of the croſs.</hi> It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that when the Apoſtle had ſpoken of Chriſts Incarnation, or his taking our nature, he calls that his <hi>emptying himſelf;</hi> ſo likewiſe when he comes to ſpeak of Chriſts ſufferings, he calls that his <hi>humbling himſelf, He humbled himſelf, and became obedient to the death.</hi> This was great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation indeed, that the Lord of glory ſhould be crucified, that the Prince of life ſhould be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and hung upon a tree:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Impaſſibilis Deus non dedignatus eſt eſſe homo paſſibilis, &amp; immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talis mortis legibus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacere.</hi> Leo.</note> 
                     <hi>He that was God impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible did not yet refuſe to become a paſſible man, and he that was immortal did not refuſe to ſubject himſelf to the laws of death.</hi> It was a great thing for God to become man; but it was a greater thing for that perſon who was God, to put himſelf into the nature of man to dye for man. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.51. <hi>I am the living bread which came down from heaven, and the bread which I will give is my fleſh, which I will give for the life of the world.</hi> Chriſt is ſaid to come down from Heaven by his Incarnation; when the Son of God took our nature into unity of perſon with himſelf, this was his coming down from Heaven. Now that the Word, as he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> that the Word, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, ſhould not only aſſume fleſh, but give that fleſh for the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:99997:227"/>life of the world, this was the higheſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love. Hence is that expreſſion of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hereby preceive we the love of God, that he lay down his life for us.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, This is the moſt illuſtrious and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous manifeſtation of the love of God to us, that that Perſon who was God laid down his life for us. He that was God by nature took up the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in a voluntary way of condeſcenſion, and having voluntarily taken up our nature, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily laid down the life of his humanity for us. It was not poſſible for him to lay down the life of his Divinity; but that Perſon who was God took up the humane nature, and in that nature laid down the life of his humanity for us. This is that which ſets forth the greatneſs of Chriſts love, that he ſhould lay down his life for us. What more contrary or unſuitable to the Nature of God than ſin, ſuffering, and death? and yet Chriſt who was God as well as man, God and man in one perſon; although he had no ſin of his own, no ſin inherent in him, yet was he content to be accounted a ſinner, <hi>He was numbered among the tranſgreſſors,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. yea, <hi>He was made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. Chriſt alſo who was above ſuffering and death, expoſed himſelf to ſuffering and death for us, <hi>He taſted death for every man, Heb.</hi> 2.9. Thus was the Son of God pleaſed out of the greatneſs of his love to us to put himſelf as it were out of Heaven into Hell, and to deſcend from the height and top of happineſs, to the loweſt degree of miſery and abaſement: <hi>He humbled himſelf,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and became obedient to the death, even the death of
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:99997:227"/>the croſs.</hi> This Doctrine of the Croſs is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtumbling-block and offence to carnal reaſon, to hear of a crucified God, to hear that he that was to be the Saviour of the world ſhould ſuffer and dye, this is that which carnal reaſon cannot away with. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>We preach Chriſt cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs.</hi> A crucified Saviour was the great ſtumbling-block to the world, and yet that which was accounted fooliſhneſs by the men of the world, was the Wiſdom of God to ſave the world by it. This, I ſay, was the loweſt degree of Chriſts humiliation or exinanition, that the Lord of glory ſhould expoſe himſelf to ſuffering and death for our ſakes, this is commonly expreſſed in that Article of our Faith, <hi>That Chriſt deſcended into Hell.</hi> When we ſay, that Chriſt deſcended into Hell, we are not to underſtand any local deſcenſion, as if Chriſt did deſcend into the place of the Damned (thus indeed <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and ſome others have underſtood that Article of a local deſcenſion) but by Chriſts deſcending into Hell we are to underſtand the loweſt degree of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, his deſcending into a ſtate of mortality and death: firſt, being content to put himſelf into a paſſible and mortal ſtate, who himſelf had been impaſſible and immortal, and then actually undergoing ſuffering and death for us. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.9. <hi>That he aſcended, what is it, but that he alſo deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firſt into the lower parts of the earth.</hi> What are thoſe lower parts of the earth into which Chriſt deſcended? Compare it with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt not leave my ſoul in hell,</hi> that is, <hi>thou ſhalt not leave it in the grave.</hi> So that Chriſts deſcending into the loweſt parts of the earth is his deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:99997:228"/>into the grave. Chriſt indeed ſuffered the pains of Hell; but we do not read he deſcended into Hell locally: and Chriſt ſuffered the pains of Hell in this life, as I had occaſion to ſhew hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But his ſoul did not locally deſcend into Hell, no, his ſoul was taken into Paradiſe, <hi>This day,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the repenting Thief, <hi>ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. Thou ſhalt be with me,</hi> that is, as a Learned man underſtands it, thy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoul ſhall be with my humane ſoul in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. Chriſt as to the preſence of his Divinity is every where; therefore when he ſpeaks of his being in Paradiſe, this is moſt properly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of his humane ſoul, that his humane ſoul was to be in Paradiſe. Chriſts deſcending into Hell therefore notes his deſcending into the ſtate of the dead, which was the completion of all his ſufferings, and the loweſt ſtate of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The love of Chriſt in his ſufferings and in the work of his Satisfaction appears in this, That we were the offending perſons, and Chriſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moſt innocent. It was we that had done the wrong and injury unto God, and yet Chriſt who had not committed the leaſt offence, was content to ſuffer for us. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.6. <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, and the Lord hath laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of us all.</hi> So in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9, 10. <hi>He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth, yet it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him.</hi> Hence alſo is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for ſin, the juſt for the unjuſt.</hi> Chriſt who was a juſt and an innocent perſon, gave himſelf to ſuffer for us who were the unjuſt and nocent perſons: yea which is much more admirable; Chriſt who was one of
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:99997:228"/>the perſons offended, unto whom the wrong and injury was done, he comes to ſuffer and bear the puniſhment for them that had committed the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The injured perſon is content to bear the puniſhment for them who had done him the wrong and injury. Sin is an offence againſt all the Perſons of the Trinity; for as all the Perſons of the Trinity have but one Eſſence, one Majeſty, one and the ſame Will, ſo ſin ſtrikes at all the Perſons, and is an offence againſt all, becauſe it is one and the ſame common Divinity that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in all; and yet the Son of God, who is one of the Perſons of the Trinity, and had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved wrong and injury from men, by reaſon of their ſins, was pleaſed to take upon him the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man, and to bear the puniſhment which man had deſerved for his offence againſt himſelf as well as againſt the other Perſons. Hence is it ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt hath given himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. Obſerve that expreſſion, <hi>That he might purifie unto himſelf.</hi> Chriſt did not give himſelf that he might purifie to the Father only a peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but alſo that he might purifie to himſelf a peculiar people. So <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Chriſt gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his Church, that he might ſanctifie and cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word, that he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church.</hi> Here it is ſaid, <hi>That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church.</hi> As Chriſt by his death and ſufferings reconciled us to God the Father, ſo he reconciled us to himſelf alſo. It is true, the Scripture, when it ſpeaks of the work of reconciliation, doth in a peculiar manner attribute it to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:99997:229"/>as the Perſon to whom we are reconciled, and it ſpeaks of our reconciliation to God by Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>All things are of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Col. 1.20. <hi>By him to reconcile all things to himſelf. By him,</hi> that is, by Chriſt: <hi>To reconcile all things to himſelf,</hi> that is, to the Father: by Chriſt then we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Father. But we muſt underſtand this aright. When it is ſaid, <hi>We are reconciled to the Father by Chriſt,</hi> we muſt not ſuppoſe that the other Perſons are excluded. We are not only reconciled to the Father, but we are reconciled to the whole Trinity, and Chriſt, conſidered as Mediator, as God-man, reconciles us to himſelf, conſidered as God ſimply. And here lies the Myſtery of Divine wiſdom and goodneſs, that <hi>God is in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf.</hi> God is the perſon offended, and yet in and by his Son it is he that offers reconciliation to the world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The greatneſs of Chriſts love in laying down his life for us appears in this, That there was no merit in us to move Chriſt to lay down his life for us. It is well obſerved by <hi>Auſtin, It was our ſins, not our merits, that drew Chriſt from Heaven to earth.</hi> As we could not merit Chriſts Incarnation, ſo neither could we merit his death and ſufferings for us. For what is it that we can ſuppoſe that ſhould merit Chriſts death and ſufferings for us? Was it our fore-ſeen faith, or our fore-ſeen obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? This is all that can be ſuppoſed. Now theſe were the effects of Chriſts death and ſufferings; therefore they could not be the cauſe of them. It is obſerved by <hi>Alvarez,</hi> That Chriſts fore-ſeen Merits were the cauſe of all that grace that was
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:99997:229"/>beſtowed upon man in the ſtate of lapſed nature: <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All the grace that we receive in lapſed nature is by Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>God hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in Chriſt.</hi> Chriſts Merits are the foundation of our faith and obedience. Whatever faith and obedience is found in us, is wrought by the Spirit of Chriſt in us. Now the Spirit it ſelf that works all grace in us, is the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and fruit of the death of Chriſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.4. <hi>After that the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour towards man appeared, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, which he ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. The Holy Ghoſt is ſhed on us abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> that is, through the Merit of Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour. Now it is by this Spirit that faith it ſelf and all other effects of grace are wrought in us; therefore it is ſaid, <hi>By grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We were ſo far from having any merit to oblige Chriſt to ſuffer and dye for us, that we were full of demerit, full of evil merits. We were ſinners, enemies, rebels againſt God, and herein <hi>God commended his love to us, that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt dyed for us, Rom.</hi> 5.8. The greateſt love amongſt men is, when one friend will dye for another, <hi>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.</hi> But where was it known, that ever any man laid down his life for his enemy? Yet <hi>Chriſt hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love to us, in that while we were enemies
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:99997:230"/>he dyed for us.</hi> Col. 1.21. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his fleſh through death.</hi> It is commonly ſaid, That ſin is a kind of <hi>God-murther,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Peccatum eſt Deici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium.</note> the ſinner would dethrone God, and take away the life and Being of God, if it lay in his power. Now herein the admirable and tranſcendent love of God to man appeared, That when man, by ſin, would dethrone God, and take away the life and Being of God, if it were in his power, that God would lay down his life for them that would take away his life and Being, <hi>God redeemed the Church with his own blood:</hi> and, <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, that he laid down his life for us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Learn to ſtudy much the greatneſs of Chriſts love in his ſufferings, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>1</label> and in the work of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Let us often have recourſe to the Croſs of Chriſt, and by the eye of faith behold the Son of God in our nature giving himſelf a Sacrifice for our ſins. The more we ſtudy the love of Chriſt in his ſufferings, and in the work of his Satisfaction, we ſhall find two notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby we ſhall be ſtrengthened and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in our belief of Chriſts love to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This will be a means to beget greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of love in our hearts to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The more we contemplate the love of Chriſt to us in his ſufferings and ſatisfaction, the more ſhall we be ſtrengthened and confirmed in our belief of Chriſts love to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. <hi>We have known and believed the love that God hath to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, for God is love.</hi> How come we to know and believe the love that God hath towards us?
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:99997:230"/>Compare this with the former verſes, and they will ſhew us, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, 9, 10. <hi>God is love. In this was manifeſted the love of God to us, that he ſent his only begotten Son, that we might live through him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was love, not that we loved God, but that God loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> When by faith we can apprehend and believe, that God hath ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins, this will confirm us in the certain belief and perſwaſion of the love of God to us. Who hath reaſon to doubt of Gods love, when he is certainly perſwaded, and doth firmly believe, that God hath ſent his Son from Heaven to earth to take our nature, and being in our nature to lay down his life and dye for our ſins? Certainly he that believes this, will find no reaſon to doubt of the love of God. If God ſent his Son to be a propitiation for our ſins, if he had no other end in ſending of him, and if the Son of God did freely lay down his life for us, then there is no reaſon that we ſhould retain ſuſpicious and jealous thoughts of the Father or the Son. <hi>We know and believe the love that God hath to us.</hi> How ſo? Becauſe <hi>God hath ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> If we can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the ſufferings of Chriſt to our minds by the eye of faith, this will confirm our ſouls in the love of God towards us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another effect of our ſtudying the love of Chriſt in his ſufferings for us is, This will be a means to beget much love in us to Chriſt. What more powerful argument to inflame our love to Chriſt, than to conſider what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered for us? Can we behold the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, God equal
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:99997:231"/>with the Father, <hi>Emmanuel</hi> God with us, God come down into our nature, can we behold this great and excellent Perſon giving himſelf to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and dye for us, taking the whole curſe and puniſhment upon himſelf that we deſerve, and not love this perſon who hath ſo loved us, and hath done and ſuffered ſuch things for us? The Apoſtle tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us. The love of Chriſt,</hi> that is, Chriſts love to us, the apprehenſion of Chriſts love to us <hi>conſtrains us,</hi> why ſo? <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>we thus judge, That if one dyed for all, then were all dead.</hi> If Chriſt had not dyed, we muſt all have dyed. If Chriſt had not ſuffered the wrath of God, we muſt have ſuffered it to Eternity. If Chriſt had not been deſerted, we muſt have been deſerted. If he had not undergone dereliction and the hiding of Gods face, the face of God muſt have been turned away from us for ever. If Chriſt had not conflicted with the Divine diſpleaſure, we muſt have conflicted with the wrath of God for ever. If Chriſt had not been caſt into that Agony, wherein he ſweat drops of blood, we muſt have been caſt into thoſe inexpreſſible hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and torments of ſoul and body, which would have preſſed us down to all Eternity. The deep and ſerious conſideration of theſe things cannot but conſtrain us to love Chriſt: <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtrains us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>becauſe we thus judge, That if one dyed for all, then were all dead.</hi> The conſideration of this, That Chriſt hath freed us from that by his death, which otherwiſe we muſt neceſſarily have undergone, muſt needs be a ſtrong ingagement upon us to love Chriſt, <hi>We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi>

If the love of Chriſt be ſo eminently ſeen in his ſuffering and dying for ſinful men, for the ſinful world, then how great is the ſin and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the world in ſlighting and abuſing all this love? God hath ſent his Son from Heaven to ſave the world, he hath ſent his Son from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to dye for the world; but all this love is little thought of, little regarded or eſteemed by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of men, this is the cauſe of the Lords great indignation againſt the world. The world is guilty of many other ſins, it is guilty of great immoralities, and many abominations in point of practice, and theſe may have their influence, and no doubt have, as to the bringing down Gods diſpleaſure upon the ſinful world; but that which is the fundamental ſin, the root ſin of all, it is the contempt of Chriſt and the Goſpel, the ſlighting and rejecting Goſpel-love, Goſpel-grace: <hi>This is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light.</hi> And we may ſay, This is the condemnation that love is come into the world, that the Son of God who is love it ſelf, the Son of God who hath all the love of the Father in him (and God is love) that he is come into the nature of man, and hath dyed for men, that they might be ſaved, and this is not at all regarded by them. When all this love of his hath been publiſhed and made known to men, the generality of men have taken no notice of Chriſt and his love: ſo they may have their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, pleaſures, and profits, take Chriſt and his

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Come now to other Particulars that ſet forth the greatneſs of Chriſts ſuffering for us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The greatneſs of Chriſts love in laying down his life for us appears in this, That there was no one elſe that could have ſatisfied for us. If men or Angels had attempted this work, their ſufferings had been but the ſufferings of finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there would not have been infinite worth and value in them to have ſatisfied for the ſins of the whole world. The expiation of ſin requires a price of infinite value, and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every ſin is committed againſt an infinite Majeſty; an infinite Majeſty being offended, there muſt be a price of infinite value to expiate the offence. Now whoever had been but a meer man, could not have offered a price of infinite value; but Chriſts ſufferings were of infinite va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, becauſe he was God as well as man: and this is that which enhanceth the price of Chriſts love, that none elſe could have ſuffered for us but Chriſt, ſo as to have ſatisfied Gods Juſtice; this Chriſt himſelf ſets before us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.3. <hi>I have trod the wine-preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me.</hi> So <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. <hi>I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondered there was none to uphold,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:99997:233"/>therefore mine own arm brought ſalvation.</hi> This commends the greatneſs of Chriſts love in his ſufferings, That when none was able to ſuffer for us, ſo as to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice, Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the work.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Conſideration is, The greatneſs of Chriſts love in his ſufferings appears in this, That ſo great and excellent a perſon ſhould come to ſuffer for us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, that he laid down his life for us,</hi> that is, that he who was the Son of God and God, that he who was ſo excellent a perſon ſhould lay down his life for us. <hi>By this perceive we the love of God,</hi> that is, this was the moſt eminent expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and declaration of the love of God, that that perſon who was no other than the Son of God and God, ſhould lay down his life for us. As the dignity and excellency of Chriſts perſon gives vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and value to his Sacrifice, ſo the dignity and excellency of his perſon is that which doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the price of his love: that ſo great and excellent a perſon ſhould come to ſuffer and to dye for us, this commends the greatneſs of Chriſts love to us, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>God redeemed the Church with his own blood.</hi> The perſon that redeemed the Church was no other than God in our nature, <hi>Without controverſie great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. <hi>In him the fulneſs of the Godhead dwells bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. <hi>The whole Divinity</hi> (ſays one of the Ancients) <hi>fills his whole humanity.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Totum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus ejus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plet tota Divinitas.</note> And <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: <hi>When the Son of God ſuffered he was not out of his own body, but the Word was intimately preſent, was perſonally united to the fleſh that ſuffered.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Non erat extra cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</note> The Word, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:99997:233"/>from, but was perſonally united to the fleſh that ſuffered; therefore he ſays, <hi>This is my body that was broken for you.</hi> The Son of God calls it his body when it was broken. Now that ſo great a perſon ſhould give himſelf to ſuffer and dye for us, this is that which demonſtrates the greatneſs of Chriſts love to us. This is notably ſet forth by the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 8. <hi>Who being in the form of God, counted it no robbery to be equal with God;</hi> and yet <hi>verſ</hi> 8. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He humbled himſelf, and became obedient to the death, even the death of the croſs.</hi> The Apoſtle ſets forth the greatneſs of Chriſts condeſcenſion and humiliation by this, That ſo great a perſon as Chriſt was ſhould come to ſuffer and dye for us: <hi>He was in the form of God, and counted it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Now that this perſon who was in the form of God, and counted it no robbery to be equal with him, that he ſhould come to ſuffer and dye for us, this was the admirableneſs of his love. And that we may ſee how excellent a perſon that was that came to ſuffer and dye for us, there are ſeveral things to be conſidered in what the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of Chriſt as a perſon long before his Incarnation, that is to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from that expreſſion, when it is ſaid,
<note place="margin">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Who exiſting in the form of God.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith of Chriſt, That he exiſted in the form of God before he took upon him the form of a ſervant. Chriſt then had his exiſtence and ſubſiſtence before his Incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He had his Exiſtence, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the Word.</hi> He ſpeaks of Chriſt the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Word, the Son of God the ſecond Perſon in
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:99997:234"/>Trinity. Now ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the Word.</hi> The Word the Son of God had his exiſtence in the beginning, that is, in the beginning of the Creation. <hi>The Word was,</hi> that is, when all other things had their being and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning given them, before that the Word was; the Word had his Being and exiſtence before that, and therefore by conſequence he was from Eternity; for whatever was before all time, that muſt needs be from Eternity. Now the Word, the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, was in the beginning, that is, he was in the beginning of time and the Creation; when all other things began to be, he had his Being and Exiſtence ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent unto this.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Evangeliſt doth not only ſay, <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the Word,</hi> but he alſo ſaith, <hi>The Word was with God;</hi> there is his ſubſiſtence, he had his ſubſiſtence with the Father in the Divine Eſſence. The firſt Propoſition, <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> declares the Eternity of the Son of God, that his Being was from Eternity. The ſecond Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>And the Word was with God,</hi> declares the manner of his Being, namely, that he had a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſubſiſtence in the Divine Eſſence with the Father. The Word, the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity had his ſubſiſtence with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Divine Eſſence. This is that which is ſet forth by the Apoſtle in this expreſſion, <hi>Who being in the form of God,</hi> or as it is moſt properly rendred, <hi>Who exiſting in the form of God.</hi> The Son of God then had his exiſtence in the <hi>form of God,</hi> before he took on him the <hi>form of a ſervant, i. e.</hi> before he took up humane nature. And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cuts the throat of that Hereſie of ſome of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:99997:234"/>the Ancients, and of the <hi>Socinians</hi> their off-ſpring, who deny that the Son of God had any exiſtence before his being born of the Virgin. The Apoſtle ſaith plainly, he had his Being and exiſtence in the <hi>form of God,</hi> before he took on him the <hi>form of a ſervant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Chriſt as a perſon before his Incarnation, ſo he ſhews what manner of perſon he was, he ſhews him to be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent perſon, yea the moſt excellent perſon: <hi>He was,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the form of God, and counted it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> We ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider both theſe expreſſions a little, becauſe this perſon of whom it is ſaid, <hi>He was in the form of God, and counted it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> this was the perſon that <hi>humbled himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obedient to the death, even the death of the croſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is ſaid, <hi>He was in the form of God.</hi> What doth that expreſſion import? The plain meaning I take to be this, That he was truly and properly God, he was God by nature, he was not God by name only, as ſome have been called Gods, and have had that appellation given to them, but were not ſo by nature; ſo Magiſtrates are ſometimes called Gods, <hi>I have ſaid ye are Gods, but ye ſhall dye like men, Pſal.</hi> 82 6. God ſaid to <hi>Moſes, I have made thee a God to Pharaoh:</hi> ſo that ſome have been called Gods by name and appellation, but were not ſo by nature; but Chriſt was ſo by nature, truly and properly God, he had the verity and truth of the Divine Eſſence in him. <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,</hi> that is, he was truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly God, as the Father was: whatever might
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:99997:235"/>be ſaid of God might be ſaid of him: God is eternal, infinite, almighty, omniſcient, now all this was Chriſt, becauſe he was in the <hi>form of God;</hi> and whatever was proper to God was proper to him,
<note place="margin">Eſſentia Dei ſuis co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loribus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picta. Eſſentia omnibus ſuis proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtita.</note> becauſe he was in the <hi>form of God. Zanchy</hi> obſerves that this expreſſion, <hi>the form of God,</hi> it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>the Eſſence of God ſet forth with all its Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, the Eſſence of God cloathed with all its proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or perfections.</hi> For although whatever is in God be God, and his moſt ſimple Eſſence really and in it ſelf, yet in reſpect of us who cannot conceive of God according to the ſimplicity of his Eſſence, there is a diſtinction in our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Eſſence and the Attributes of God: ſo that the <hi>form of God</hi> (according to our underſtanding) notes the Eſſence of God with the Attributes belonging to it: ſo that the meaning is, Chriſt was in the form of God, that is, he had the verity and truth of the Divine Eſſence in him, and he had all the Attributes belonging to that Eſſence. <hi>He was in the form of God,</hi> that is, he was truly and properly God, he was eternal, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, omnipreſent, and the like: whatſoever might be ſaid of God may be ſaid of Chriſt the Son of God, becauſe he was in the <hi>form of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>he accounted it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> This expreſſion notes two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt knew himſelf to be equal with the Father, he knew that he was poſſeſſed of the ſame Eſſence, of the ſame Majeſty, of the ſame Glory that the Father was, <hi>All things that the Father hath are mine, Joh</hi> 16.15. The Son injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all things in common with the Father, the ſame Eſſence, the ſame Power, the ſame Majeſty, the ſame Divinity. <hi>I and the Father are one,</hi> Joh.
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:99997:235"/>10.30. that is, one in Eſſence, one in Power, one in Will.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This alſo is implied, That <hi>the Son being in the form of God, and equal with the Father,</hi> knew he ſhould do no wrong and injury if he retained and kept to himſelf the ſame honour that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did, that is, if he had always kept in the form of God only, and never emptied himſelf by his Incarnation and ſuffering. The Father abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth always in the <hi>form of God</hi> only, and never took upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> it was the Son (not the Father) that was incarnate, and that took on him the <hi>form of a ſervant.</hi> Now if the Son had always kept in the <hi>form of God,</hi> and never took upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> he had done no wrong or injury, he was in the ſame honour and dignity of God with the Father, and he might have retained the ſame honour and dignity that the Father did, without abaſing himſelf by his Incarnation and ſuffering. <hi>He was in the form of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, that is, he did ſubſiſt in the Divine Eſſence, as the Father did; he might have continued in the form of God only, without taking on him the form of a ſervant, without aſſuming or taking to himſelf the humane nature; but herein his love diſcovered it ſelf, That though he was in the <hi>form of God,</hi> and knew himſelf to be <hi>equal with God,</hi> yet he was pleaſed in a way of voluntary condeſcenſion to take upon him the <hi>form of a ſervant,</hi> and ſubject himſelf <hi>to the death, even the death of the croſs.</hi> Now that ſo great a perſon as this, that had his exiſtence and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence from Eternity, who was truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, poſſeſſed of the Divine Eſſence, and cloathed with all the Divine Attributes, who
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:99997:236"/>was equal to the Father, that this perſon ſhould not only ſtrip himſelf, as it were, of his own glory by his Incarnation, but alſo expoſe himſelf to the loweſt abaſement by his ſufferings and moſt ignominious death, this is that which ſets forth the greatneſs of the love of Chriſt. Now there are ſeveral conſiderations that ariſe from the dignity of Chriſts perſon that ſerve to ſet forth the greatneſs of Chriſts love to us in giving himſelf to ſuffer and to dye for us, and O that we could take in theſe Myſteries with that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and ſolemnity of ſpirit, as the Majeſty of them doth require.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider, it was the Word, the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity that did order and diſpoſe the ſufferings that were in his own fleſh, his own humanity. Hence is that of one of the Ancients:
<note place="margin">

                     <hi>The Word, the Son of God, the ſecond Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Trinity was the diſpenſer and determiner of all the actions and ſufferings that were in the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> It was he that ordered, diſpoſed, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned the Humanity to do and ſuffer thoſe things that were proper to it ſelf. The humane nature in Chriſt was not moved of it ſelf to any of its actions or ſufferings, but it was moved <hi>ad nutum Verbi,</hi> at the beck and command of the Word, that is, according to the direction of that perſon who aſſumed the humane nature: the Word, the Son of God did will and permit the Humanity to do and ſuffer ſuch things as were proper to it ſelf, it was he that governed the actions and paſſions of the humane nature. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.19. <hi>For their ſakes ſanctifie I my ſelf.</hi> To ſanctifie is properly the work of God, and none but God can ſanctifie; Chriſt therefore as God ſanctified himſelf as man, the
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:99997:236"/>Divine nature in Chriſt ſanctified and ſet apart the humane nature for the work of the ſuffering; it was the Divine nature in Chriſt which did pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily will the ſufferings in the humane nature, which did permit the humane nature to ſuffer, and which did ſtrengthen and uphold the humane nature in ſuffering; and all theſe things do greatly ſet forth the love of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was the Divine nature in Chriſt which did primarily will the ſufferings of the humane nature. It is true, Chriſt as man did will his own ſufferings, Chriſt as man was willing to ſuffer and dye for us; but yet we muſt conſider, that his humane will was influenced and governed by his Divine will; the humane will of Chriſt willed thoſe things which the Divine will would have it to will: therefore it being the pleaſure of the Divine will that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, Chriſt alſo as man wills his own ſufferings by his humane will; but ſtill it is the Divine will in Chriſt that is firſt, and the humane will in Chriſt is governed by the Divine will. This is very clear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent from our Saviours own words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.39. <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi> Here we ſee, that Chriſt with his humane will wills his own ſufferings, <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt:</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid, If thou wilt have me ſuffer, I will ſuffer, I am content to ſuffer, <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt:</hi> his humane will was bowed to the Fathers will, the Father willing his ſufferings, he wills it too. It is true, our Saviour diſcovered the verity and truth of humane nature in him in that averſneſs that was in him from death and ſuffering, in thoſe words, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:99997:237"/>let this cup paſs from me.</hi> Though Chriſt did diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the verity and truth of humane nature in him by thoſe expreſſions, yet his will was not abſolutely bent and ſet againſt ſuffering, and that appears from hence, That knowing it to be his Fathers will that he ſhould ſuffer, he did readily and preſently comply with the will of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but when he ſaith, <hi>Father, if it be poſſible let this cup paſs from me,</hi> he ſhews that the verity and truth of our nature was in him, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of nature was not to ſuffer; he ſhewed this, that humane nature, as humane nature, had no delight in ſuffering. But now ſeeing it was his Fathers will that he ſhould ſuffer, he puts off nature as it were, lays aſide the inclinations of it, and ſaith, <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done.</hi> His Father willing ſuffering; he wills it too, <hi>not as I will, but as thou wilt:</hi> as much as if he ſhould ſay, If thou wilt have me ſuffer, I am willing, I am content to ſuffer; Chriſt therefore, as man, willed his own ſufferings, but ſtill, as I ſaid at firſt, his humane will was governed by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will, ſo that it was the Divine will that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his ſufferings primarily, and the humane will was carried out by the Divine will to will them in conformity thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It was the Divine nature in Chriſt that did permit the humane nature to ſuffer. If the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity had exerted it ſelf, and put forth its power and efficacy, it could and would have prevented all ſuffering and death in the humane nature. <hi>No man,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>takes my life from me, I lay it down of my ſelf, Joh.</hi> 10.18. Had not Chriſt freely and voluntarily laid down his own life, no man could have taken away his life from him.
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:99997:237"/>And hence is it that the Ancients do often uſe this expreſſion, <hi>That in the Sufferings and Paſſion of Chriſt the Divinity in Chriſt aid reſt,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> it did not put forth its virtue; for if the Divinity, which was perſonally united to the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had exerted its virtue, it had certainly prevented all ſufferings in the Humanity; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Divinity did ſuſpend its influence, that ſo the humane nature might be in a capacity to ſuffer. The Divine nature did not put forth its ſtrength and efficacy to reſtrain the ſufferings of the humane nature. And this ſhews the love of Chriſt, that the Divine nature ſuſpended its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, that ſo the humane nature might be in a capacity to ſuffer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was the Divine nature that did ſtrengthen and uphold the humane nature in ſuffering: ſo great was the burden of our ſins, and Gods wrath that was due to us for them, that it was enough to have ſunk a meer creature, if there had not been infinite and almighty power to ſupport it. Now the Humanity of Chriſt, conſidered in it ſelf, being but a creature, could not of it ſelf have ſtood under the weight and burden of our ſins and Divine wrath, therefore was it ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the infinite and almighty power of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore is it ſaid, That <hi>Chriſt by the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God,</hi> Heb. 9.14. <hi>By the eternal Spirit,</hi> that is, Chriſt was ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the power of the Deity in offering himſelf as a Sacrifice for our ſins.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Conſideration is this, The Word, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity was united to the fleſh when the fleſh ſuffered, the union between the two natures in Chriſt was not diſſolved, but
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:99997:238"/>it continued firm and inviolable in the time of Chriſts ſuffering.

So in the words of the Sacrament, <hi>This is my body which is broken for you;</hi> the fleſh that was given up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſs was his fleſh, the fleſh of the Word, his own proper fleſh, not another mans, but the fleſh of the Word, the fleſh of him that came down from Heaven, <hi>I am the bread that came down from heaven, and the bread which I will give is my fleſh:</hi> ſo likewiſe it is ſaid, <hi>This is my body.</hi> Hence is that expreſſion of <hi>Athanaſius:
<note place="margin">Caro illa t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat corpus Dei.</note> That fleſh which ſuffered was the body of God:</hi> not that God hath a body; but thus we muſt underſtand it, God was perſonally preſent with, perſonally united to that body that ſuffered. Another of the Ancients hath this paſſage:
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dominus gloriae erat in corpore quod cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figebatur.</hi> Epiphan.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord of Glory was in that body which was crucified, which was ſtruck through, which did ſuffer, that body of his being no other but the Temple of the Word, the Temple of the Son of God, it was full of the Deity. And hence was it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the Sun beholding its Maker in the aſſumed body, withdrew its rays, and was covered with darkneſs.</hi> So we read, that in the time of our Saviours Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion there was a darkneſs over all the earth from the ſixth hour to the ninth hour. O what an aſtoniſhing Myſtery is this! How great a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle muſt this needs be to the holy Angels to ſee the Son of God and God, that perſon whom they were wont to worſhip and adore in Heaven, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally united to that fleſh which was now hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Croſs, and ſuffering in that fleſh which
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:99997:238"/>he had aſſumed. If this muſt needs be matter of wonder and aſtoniſhment to the Angels, well may it be to us. This is one of the things the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, when he ſpeaks of the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, <hi>Without controverſie,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>great is the myſtery of godlineſs, God manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels,</hi>

And as this was matter of great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to the Angels to ſee God come down into our nature, ſo it ought to be to us; and certainly as it was matter of wonder to the Angels to ſee God incarnate, ſo it was matter of greater won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to them to ſee God ſuffering and dying in the nature of man for man.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. THE third Conſideration ariſing from the Dignity of Chriſts Perſon, to ſhew the greatneſs of his love in his ſufferings is this, It was the Deity, the Divine nature in Chriſt that gave virtue and efficacy to the ſufferings of the humane nature.
<note place="margin">Chemnitius</note> It is the obſervation of a Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Divine, That it is one thing to ſpeak of the Paſſion and death of Chriſt, as it is the property of the humane nature, and another thing to ſpeak of the Paſſion and death of Chriſt, as by that Paſſion and death of his the wrath of God is pacified, the head of the Serpent broken, death deſtroyed, and life reſtored; theſe are the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Divine power, although not without the humane nature. The humane nature could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have done this without the virtue of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Therefore we muſt conſider, that although it was in the humane nature that Chriſt obeyed and kept the Law; and though it was in the humane nature that he ſuffered and dyed: yet it was by the power and virtue of the Deity, that theſe actions and ſufferings of the humane nature were meritorious and ſatisfactory as to God, and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary as to men, that is, that they had an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon our ſalvation. Had not Chriſt been
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:99997:240"/>God as well as man, neither would his actions and ſufferings been ſatisfactory and meritorious with God, neither would they have brought ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto us? Who but God could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered death, hell, and the grave? Who but God could have wrought out redemption and ſalvation for us? Hence is it, that the Church in her tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Song, when ſhe declares how it was that her ſalvation was wrought out for her, ſhe attributes it wholly unto God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Behold, God is my ſalvation, the Lord Jehovah is my ſtrength and my ſong, he alſo is become my ſalvation.</hi> The Church looks upon all her ſalvation to be from God in Chriſt, <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. It was God in Chriſt that gave the ranſon, and laid down the price for the Churches redemption, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Particular to ſet forth the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſts love in the work of his ſufferings from the conſideration of the dignity of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, That in the ſufferings of Chriſt there was the humiliation of the whole perſon of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, who was God as well as man. This is a great thing to ſet forth the love of Chriſt in his ſufferings, to conſider how great a perſon he was that humbled himſelf, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and became obedient to the death.</hi> Who was he that humbled himſelf? that very perſon which the Apoſtle had ſpoken of before. Now the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which he had ſpoken of before, was <hi>he who was in the form of God, and counted it no robbery to be equal with God.</hi> Now this was the perſon that humbled himſelf; as this perſon emptied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:99997:241"/>in his Incarnation; ſo the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>He made himſelf of no reputation, he took upon him the form of a ſervant;</hi> ſo the very ſame perſon hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf in his ſufferings, <hi>he humbled himſelf, and became obedient to the death.</hi> Chriſts humiliation both in his Incarnation and in his ſufferings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the whole perſon of the Mediator, who is God as well as man. <hi>Zanchy</hi> obſerves from that, <hi>He was in the form of God, and took upon him the form of a ſervant,</hi> That as Chriſt is Mediator ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to both natures, ſo the whole perſon, by reaſon of his taking on him the form of a ſervant, is become a ſervant. Now as the whole perſon of the Mediator, <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in his Incarnation, humbled in his aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our nature; ſo the whole perſon of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator is humbled in his ſufferings, in his <hi>being obedient to the death, the death of the croſs.</hi> It is true, this humiliation of the Son of God both in his Incarnation and in his ſufferings properly agrees and belongs to the humane nature; and the reaſon is, becauſe the Deity, ſimply and in it ſelf conſidered, is not capable of humiliation or abaſement; but yet we muſt know by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Idioms, as they call it, that being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the whole perſon, which is proper to either of the natures, the whole perſon of the Mediator is ſaid to be humbled both in his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and in his ſufferings: ſo that it was the perſon of the Son of God who humbled himſelf, taking on him the form of a ſervant, and it was the perſon of the Son of God who humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, being <hi>obedient to the death, even the death of the croſs.</hi> Now it is a contemplation worthy of our moſt ſerious thoughts to conſider how in the
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:99997:241"/>death and ſufferings of Jeſus Chriſt there was the humiliation of the whole perſon, and this I ſhall endeavour to open in a few Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is evident, That Chriſt as God willed his own ſufferings as man. If Chriſt had not willed his own ſufferings, no one could have brought ſufferings upon him; for <hi>no man takes away my life,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.18. <hi>No man takes away my life,</hi> that is, no one hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to take it away, unleſs I firſt give it. This therefore we may take for granted, That Chriſt as God willed his own ſufferings as man. Now conſider what a condeſcenſion was this, that that perſon who was in the form of God, and was equal with God, and knew himſelf to be ſo, ſhould yet will the taking up of our nature, and alſo will his own ſufferings in that nature. This was the greateſt condeſcenſion, that he that knew the dignity of his own perſon, his equality with the Father, ſhould yet in a voluntary way will his own abaſement: that he who was equal with the Father in reſpect of his Divine nature, ſhould yet by taking on him the nature of man and office of Mediator, make himſelf inferiour to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for as he was man and Mediator, ſo the Father was <hi>greater than he, Joh.</hi> 14.28. Compare theſe two Texts together <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. and that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. In <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. it is ſaid, <hi>He was in the form of God, and counted it no robbery to be equal with God,</hi> and in <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. it is ſaid, <hi>The Father is greater than I.</hi> How is this to be underſtood? He that was equal with the Father in reſpect of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, the ſame perſon becoming man and Mediator, ſo he made himſelf inferiour to the Father, and ſo the Father was greater than he.
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:99997:242"/>This was the condeſcenſion and love of this great perſon, that he that was in an equality with the Father in reſpect of the Divine nature, becoming man and Mediator makes himſelf inferiour to him: this will appear yet farther in the next Particular.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt by taking on him the office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, became ſubject to the Father; therefore doth the Apoſtle fay, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.3. That <hi>the head of Chriſt is God.</hi> Chriſt as he is made man hath God for his head, is ſubject unto him, is under God as his head. Hence alſo is it ſaid, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. That <hi>he became obedient to the death.</hi> Chriſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him the office of Mediator became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to his Father, and he underwent ſuffering and death in a way of obedience to him. Now this was the great condeſcenſion of this excellent perſon, who when he knew himſelf to be in a ſtate of equality with the Father, would yet put himſelf into a ſtate of ſubjection to him, and in obedience to the Fathers will expoſe himſelf to ſuffering and death. This is that which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf intimates to us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.30, 31. <hi>Hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me. But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave me commandment, even ſo I do.</hi> Satan or men had nothing to do with Chriſt, they had no power over his life; but Chriſt laid down his own life meerly in obedience to the Father, and out of his love to us. <hi>The Prince of this world comes and finds nothing in me.</hi> Satan had no right or power to touch Chriſts life, but Chriſt had the power to diſpoſe of his own life as he pleaſed, and having freely and of his own accord taken
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:99997:242"/>on him the office of Mediator, he muſt be ſubject to the Father, and diſpoſe of his life as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and his Father commanding him to dye, he muſt give up his life in obedience to him. Thus he that was the Author and Prince of life, he that gives life to all others, was content to give up his own life to be at the Fathers diſpoſe; and this ſpeaks the humiliation of this great perſon that was in a ſtate of equality with the Father, that he would in a voluntary way of condeſcenſion make himſelf ſubject to him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſet forth the humiliation of the perſon, how he humbled himſelf in the work of his Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, let us conſider, that it is the perſon of the Divine Word, or the ſecond Perſon in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſubſiſting in humane nature, that tenders and offers the ſatisfaction by the operations of the humane nature. To underſtand this we muſt conſider, that the operations and paſſions of the humane nature in Chriſt are not,
<note place="margin">Non princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium quod, ſed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium quo.</note> as the Schools call it, the <hi>Principle that</hi> makes the ſatisfaction, but they are the <hi>Principle by</hi> which ſatisfaction is made. The <hi>Principle that,</hi> as they call it, which makes ſatisfaction is the perſon of the Word, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity which ſubſiſts in humane nature; and the ground of it is founded upon this Logical Axiom, <hi>That actions belong to perſons,
<note place="margin">Actiones ſant ſuppoſe, torum.</note> or actions flow from perſons.</hi> It was therefore the perſon of the Word that made ſatisfaction for our ſins. Now that a perſon of that infinite worth and excellency as the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in Trinity, ſhould come to ſubſiſt in our nature, and being in our nature ſhould be the perſon ſatisfying for our ſins, this was great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion and abaſement. Thus the Son who
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:99997:243"/>was yet equal with the Father in reſpect of his Divine nature, by his Incarnation and ſufferings doth not only make himſelf inferiour to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to himſelf alſo. The Son, though he was one of the perſons offended, yet he comes to make the ſatisfaction, and conſidered as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as God-man, doth not only make ſatisfaction to the Father, but to himſelf, conſidered as God ſimply.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Conſideration is this, That whole Chriſt, or the whole perſon of the Mediator, was the price of our Redemption, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> It is Chriſt then that is the propitiation for our ſins. Now Chriſt is the name of the perſon ſubſiſting in both natures. When we ſpeak of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Chriſtus est nomen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonae in duabus ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtentis na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turis.</note> we underſtand that perſon who ſubſiſts in both natures, in the nature of God and in the nature of man. Chriſt doth not ſignifie one of the natures ſimply, but Chriſt is the name of the perſon ſubſiſting in both natures. Now this is he who is the propitiation for our ſins, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is God and man, he is the propitiation for our ſins.
<note place="margin">Perſona Christi ſive Chriſtus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfecit pro peccatis tanquam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quod.</note> 
                     <hi>It was the perſon of Chriſt or Chriſt that did ſatisfie for our ſins as the Principle making ſatisfaction.</hi> To underſtand this we muſt conſider that which was before hinted, That Chriſt is our Mediator according to both natures; he is not our Mediator as to one of his natures only, but according to both natures; and as he is Mediator according to both natures, ſo he gives himſelf for us according to both his natures. For though it were the humane nature only that ſuffered, yet it was the Divine nature that ſanctified the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:99997:243"/>of the humane nature, and gave virtue to them; therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Himſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi> and <hi>that by himſelf he hath purged our ſins, Heb.</hi> 1.3. It is not ſaid, By his humane nature meerly (though it is true it was the humane nature only that was capable of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, but it is not ſo expreſſed) but <hi>by himſelf.</hi> Chriſt himſelf is the Sacrifice for our ſins, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>He loved me, and gave himſelf for me:</hi> and, <hi>Chriſt was once offered up, Heb.</hi> 9. And that expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> is very emphatical, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Who his own ſelf bare our ſins in his body on the tree.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> Chriſt himſelf who was God-man made ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for ſins, and laid down the price of our Redemption, yea he himſelf was the price of our Redemption, <hi>God hath redeemed the Church with his own blood.</hi> To underſtand this two things are to be conſidered in the Satisfaction of Chriſt, as <hi>Alvarez</hi> hath obſerved.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One is that ſpecies or kind of humane acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which Chriſt did ſatisfie, and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the humane nature, as the formal principle of them. Thus the Son of God obeyed, ſuffered, dyed in the humane nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is another thing to be conſidered in Chriſts Satisfaction, and that is the infinite value and worth that was found in it. Now the infinite value and worth that was in the Satisfaction of Chriſt proceeded from the perſon ſatisfying, that is, from the Divine Word or the perſon of the Son of God ſubſiſting in the humane nature: the actions and ſufferings of the humane nature are the matter of his Satisfaction, but that which gives the virtue and value to them is the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Hence are thoſe expreſſions of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients:
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:99997:244"/>
                     <hi>If he had not been true God he had not brought a remedy for us.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Si non eſſet verus Deus non afferret remedium. Quia ille qui morie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur erat Deus.</note> Another obſerves: <hi>That therefore did the death of Chriſt bring ſalvation to the world, becauſe the perſon who dyed was God.</hi> And another hath a paſſage to this purpoſe: <hi>Death,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>becoming as it were the death of God, hath demoliſhed death, for the perſon that dyed was God and man both, the ſufferings of Chriſt being made the ſufferings of that perſon who was God, received their virtue from the Divinity.</hi> As much as if he had ſaid, By virtue of the Divine perſon which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the humane nature, thoſe ſufferings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their virtue to ſave us, and to make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſins. This is another thing that diſcovers the humiliation of Chriſts perſon, That he who was God, and in his Divine nature ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply conſidered, was the perſon offended, yet as God man was pleaſed to become a ranſom for us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He gave himſelf a ranſom for all.</hi> That perſon who gave himſelf a ranſom for all is the Mediator, and who is the Mediator but God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> There is a great Emphaſis upon thoſe words <hi>Jeſus Chriſt his Son.</hi> It is the blood of that perſon who was no other than the Son of God and God which cleanſeth us from all ſin. It is a memorable ſpeech of <hi>Luther: He gave,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not ſilver, not gold, neither was it a meer man that he gave, neither did he give all the Angels, but it was himſelf that he gave as the price of our Redemption, than which nothing was greater, neither had he any thing greater to give.</hi> Conſider this price aright, and we ſhall find it infinitely greater than the whole Creation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the ſufferings of Chriſt we may ſee the
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:99997:244"/>humiliation of his perſon from hence, namely, that in the death of Chriſt the glory of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſeemed to be moſt obſcured and darkened, and ſuffered the greateſt Eclipſe. What more unworthy of God than ſuffering and death? What more abſurd and incongruous in the eye of carnal reaſon than a crucified God? Now herein did Chriſt commend the greatneſs of his love to us, That he permitted the glory of his Divinity, by means of his death and ſuffering, to be eclipſed for our ſakes: That he who was the immortal God, ſhould expoſe himſelf to ſuffering and death for our ſakes, as if he had been no more than a paſſible and mortal man; for though he were really and indeed the Son of God and God, the Lord of Glory, yet by reaſon of his death and ſufferings he was by the generality of men thought to be but as an ordinary man. This is that which the Apoſtle intimates, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Whom none of the Princes of this world knew, for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</hi> The Apoſtle here ſpeaks of Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, as the Wiſdom of God, this the Princes of the world knew not. The Rabbies among the Jews, the Philoſophers among the Heathen knew not this Wiſdom of God, they were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it, they little knew the Lord of Glory was in that body that was crucified, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and that hung upon the Croſs; they were ignorant of the Divinity of Chriſts perſon, the Son of God containing and keeping in the rays of his Divinity, and permitting his fleſh, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature to ſuffer, they thought him to be but as another man. Hence was it, that the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors mockt him with thoſe words, <hi>If thou be the
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:99997:245"/>Son of God come down from the croſs:</hi> they took it for granted, that he that was the Son of God and God, would not have ſuffered in that manner. Now this was the great, the wonderful, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious humiliation of this great Perſon, that the Divinity in Chriſt hid it ſelf and withdrew its luſtre as it were in the time of Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſo the Humanity might ſuffer. It is true, there were ſome rays of his Divinity let forth in the time of his ſuffering, that the veil of the Temple was rent from the top to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that the rocks clave in ſunder, that the Sun was darkened, and the graves were opened and the bodies of the dead Saints aroſe. Such prodigious things as theſe were manifeſt tokens that the perſon that ſuffered was more than an ordinary perſon: therefore the Centurion and thoſe that were with him ſaid, <hi>Truly this was the Son of God.</hi> But yet theſe things had not ſuch an influence upon the generality of men, but that the Croſs of Chriſt was <hi>to the Jews a ſtumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs;</hi> the world hath not been able to bear the Doctrine of a crucified Saviour: and as <hi>Luther</hi> hath obſerved, There is no Doctrine of Faith that the world is ſo offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at as this, That whereas the wiſdom and love of God hath been laid out to the uttermoſt in this way, namely, to ſave men by the death of his Son, this hath been the greateſt offence to the world, Such is the pride and ignorance of men, that they cannot think of being ſaved by one that was crucified. But what doth the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſay, <hi>The fooliſhneſs of God is wiſer than men, and the weakneſs of God is ſtronger than men. Chriſt crucified is the power of God and the wiſdom of God,</hi>
                     <pb n="473" facs="tcp:99997:245"/>1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20, 24. Whatever the world thinks of it, this is the way of God and the wiſdom of God to ſave men by the death of his own Son. And herein did the greatneſs of Chriſts love to us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That he who was ſo great a Perſon, would ſuffer the glory of his Divinity to be obſcured and darkened by his death and ſufferings, whenas he knew what he did and ſuffered for man would expoſe him to the diſeſteem of men, and miniſter an occaſion to them to think the more contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly of him than ever they would have done, had he not ſtooped ſo low to do and ſuffer ſuch things as he did for their ſakes.</p>

This is notably ſet forth by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, We were redeemed not with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things, as gold and ſilver, from our vain converſation, but with the precious blood of Chriſt,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>Precious blood</hi> indeed which was the blood of that perſon that was God as well as man. It is well obſerved by <hi>Cyril: It was not the blood of</hi> Peter <hi>or</hi> Paul, <hi>or ſome other particular Saint that was but a meer man, that we were redeemed by, but it was by the blood of Chriſt, God-man, whoſe name is Emmanuel God with us.</hi>

                  </p>

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:99997:246"/>and of his ſufferings, muſt needs be the moſt hainous ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As for the contempt of Chriſts perſon, the Apoſtle calls it <hi>a treading under foot the Son of God.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. The contempt of Chriſts ſufferings is ſet forth in that other expreſſion, <hi>And hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he is ſanctified an unholy thing.</hi> We may render it thus,

                     <hi>Who hath counted the blood of the Covenant a common thing.</hi> To count the blood of the Covenant, the blood of Chriſt as common blood, to count the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt but as the ſufferings of a common ordinary man, this is great contempt. The blood of Chriſt is the blood of that perſon who is God as well as man; and therefore to reckon his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings but as the ſufferings of a common ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, this is great contempt. The perſon ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for us was no other than the Son of God, and <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. The ſufferings of this perſon therefore were not the ſufferings of a common ordinary perſon, but they were the ſufferings of him who was God-man, they were the ſufferings of the <hi>Word made fleſh,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:99997:247"/>who gave his fleſh for the life of the world.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to contemn ſo great and excellent a perſon, and all that he ſuffered in love to us, muſt needs be the greateſt ſin.</p>
                  <p>But here it may be inquired, When is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt contemned, and when are his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings contemned?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then is the perſon of Chriſt in a degree at leaſt contemned, when we have not honourable thoughts of Chriſt, ſuitable to the dignity of his perſon, that is to ſay, when we ſtick in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity without elevating our thoughts to his Divinity: our faith muſt indeed begin at the Humanity of Chriſt, but it muſt not ſtick or reſt there, but we muſt climb up from the Humanity to the Divinity. When therefore we ſtick in the Humanity of Chriſt without elevating our thoughts to his Divinity, this is not to have ſo honourable thoughts of Chriſt as we ought to have, and ſo by conſequence it is a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of him. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.1. <hi>Ye believe in God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve alſo in me:</hi> as much as if our Saviour ſhould ſay, You all take it to be your duty to believe in God: <hi>You believe in God,</hi> ſimply conſidered, O but that is not enough; as you believe in God, ſimply conſidered, ſo you ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God inhabiting in the fleſh of the Son. Conſider what our Saviour ſaith in the ninth verſe of that Chapter, <hi>He that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father:</hi> the meaning of that I take to be, He that hath ſeen the Son incarnate with a ſpiritual eye, with an eye of faith, he that hath ſeen the Son incarnate as he ought to ſee him, he hath ſeen the Divinity of the Father in the perſon of the Son, the Father and the Son have but one and
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:99997:247"/>the ſame common Divinity. Therefore if we ſee the Son aright with a ſpiritual eye, with an eye of faith, we ſhall ſee the Divinity of the Father in the perſon of the Son. Though the perſon of the Father is diſtinct from the perſon of the Son, yet the Divinity of the Father is not different from the Divinity of the Son: though the Father and the Son be diſtinct as to their perſons, yet there is but one and the ſame common Divinity between them both, <hi>I and the Father are one, Joh.</hi> 10.30. He that ſuppoſeth the Divinity or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of the Father to differ from the Godhead of the Son, doth neither know the Father nor the Son. When therefore we do not elevate our thoughts to the Divinity of the Son, we do in a degree contemn Chriſt: when we do not look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the veil of his fleſh, and behold that Divine perſon that took up that fleſh, we do not give Chriſt that honour we ought to do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then is the perſon of Chriſt contemned, when we do not believe in Chriſt for ſalvation. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. <hi>He that believeth on him is not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but he that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> There is a great weight that lies upon that expreſſion, <hi>the name of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God:</hi> the reaſon why Unbelievers are condemned is, becauſe ſo great a perſon, ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a perſon as <hi>the only begotten Son of God</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and offered to them in the Goſpel, and they refuſe to cloſe with him. When the Son of God is propounded to men as the great object of their faith, and ſo great and excellent a perſon as this is rejected by them, this is the greateſt contempt, and this is that which brings condemnation upon men.</p>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:99997:248"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Then are the ſufferings of Chriſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when men do not apply and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the virtue of Chriſts ſufferings to obtain ſalvation by them: <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Joh. 1.29. <hi>Him hath God ordained to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, Rom.</hi> 3.25. The ſufferings of Chriſt were the great propitiatory Sacrifice, the only means to reconcile us to God. Now when men hearken to the ſufferings of Chriſt, as a ſtory meerly, they can hear it diſcourſed of and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again and again, that there was ſuch a perſon that did and ſuffered ſuch things, but they do not look upon themſelves as concerned, they ſee no need of the merit and virtue of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, neither do they apply themſelves to the ſufferings and death of Chriſt, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive atonement by it, this is to make the <hi>blood of the Covenant a common thing,</hi> as the Apoſtles expreſſion is in the fore-mentioned place. It is as if ſo be men accounted the blood of Chriſt but as common blood, and his ſufferings no more than the ſufferings of an ordinary man. A like phraſe the Apoſtle hath, when he ſpeaks of ſome that come unworthily to the Lords Table, he ſaith, <hi>They do not diſcern the Lords body,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.29. <hi>Not to diſcern the Lords body,</hi> is not to make a difference between the ſacramental bread and common ordinary bread, not to ſee the Lords body repreſented to us in and by that bread. <hi>Not to diſcern the Lords body,</hi> is, not to owne and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the preciouſneſs of that body, that is, not to be able to diſtinguiſh this body from another body, not to ſee an excellency in it. In like manner to account the blood of Chriſt, <hi>the
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:99997:248"/>blood of the Covenant a common thing,</hi> is, not to ſee the preciouſneſs of this blood, not to have a high eſteem of it, and not to apply our ſelves for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to it. They that do not ſee the infinite worth and preciouſneſs of the ſufferings of Chriſt, that do not apply themſelves to the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, ſo as to extract ſalvation from them, they contemn the ſufferings of Chriſt. Our Saviour himſelf ſaith expreſly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53. <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of the Son of man, you have no life in you.</hi> Let us not think that it is an indifferent thing, a matter of ſmall moment, whether we underſtand the worth of Chriſts ſufferings, and apply our ſelves to them yea or no. Our Saviour tells us plainly our ſalvation depends upon it, <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh, and drink the blood of the Son of man, ye have no life in you.</hi> That is, unleſs ye have skill to make uſe of my ſufferings, and to apply your ſelves to the virtue of them, <hi>ye have no life in you,</hi> that is, you have not the life of Juſtification nor ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in you here in this world, neither ſhall you have the life of Glory hereafter: therefore it is not an indifferent thing whether we be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the virtue of Chriſts ſufferings, without this we have no life in us. Let us therefore take heed how we have ſlight thoughts of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt; this is to ſlight them, when we do not ſtudy the virtue of theſe ſufferings, when we do not ſee our need of them, and do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to them, that we may be ſaved by them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then are the ſufferings of Chriſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, when we come unworthily to the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. The Sacrament of the Supper, it is the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:99997:249"/>of the body and blood of Chriſt; when therefore we ruſh upon the Sacrament in a rude manner, we do in an eminent way contemn the ſufferings of Chriſt. The Supper of the Lord is called <hi>a ſhewing forth the Lords death,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.26. <hi>As often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lords death till he come.</hi> This phraſe of <hi>ſhewing forth the Lords death</hi> implies three things in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It implies the inward aſſent of the mind, that we do indeed with our hearts and minds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Chriſt did dye, and ſuffer ſuch things for us, as we read of in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This phraſe of <hi>ſhewing forth the Lords death</hi> implies the profeſſion and confeſſion of our faith before the world,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that we owne it and profeſs it before the world, that we believe ſuch and ſuch things concerning Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It implies our faith in our our reliance upon the death and ſufferings of Chriſt for ſalvation, that is our expectation of ſalvation by the death of Chriſt, and by that means only. All this I take to be implied in this phraſe of ſhewing forth the death of Chriſt: the Sacrament therefore being a ſhewing forth of Chriſts death, when we come to the Sacrament, we have to do with the death and ſufferings of Chriſt in a peculiar manner; if therefore we ruſh upon that Ordinance in a rude or unworthy manner, we muſt of neceſſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn the ſufferings of Chriſt, becauſe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſpecial and peculiar Ordinance that is appointed to repreſent to us the death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of the Lord Jeſus: and that this is one way of contemning Chriſts ſufferings, the Apoſtle is exceeding clear and plain, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:99997:249"/>ſhall eat and drink this cup of the Lord unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> As much as if he ſhould ſay, Every unworthy Communicant, every unworthy receiver at the Lords Table is guilty of no ſmall ſin, he is guilty of the very body and blood of Chriſt, that is, he is as one that hath imbrued his hands in Chriſts blood, <hi>he is guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</hi> The Ancients expound it to this ſenſe: Every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiver and Communicant that comes in a rude manner to the Lords Supper, is like <hi>Judas</hi> that betrayed Chriſt, like the Jews that buffeted and ſpit upon him, like to <hi>Pilate</hi> that condemned him, and like the Souldiers that crucified him; theſe dealt unworthily with the body of Chriſt, and ſo doth every unworthy Communicant deal unworthily with the body of Chriſt. The others indeed abuſed and dealt unworthily with his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, but every unworthy Communicant deals unworthily with his ſacramental body: and the ſin of the one is ſo much the greater than the ſin of the other, becauſe many of them that had a hand in the crucifixion of the body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, looked upon him as an ordinary man, they did not look upon him as the Son of God. Hence doth the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>If they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. But now rude Chriſtians who ruſh irreverently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Ordinance, do profeſs they believe him to be the Son of God, the Saviour of the world, and yet offer indignity to him. They therefore that come unworthily to the Lords Table, do in an eminent manner contemn the ſufferings of Chriſt. But here it may be uſeful for us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, What is it to come unworthily? Who
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:99997:250"/>are they that come unworthily? <hi>Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread,

<note place="margin">Indecenter, parùm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruè, minùs appoſité.</note> ſignifies in this place as much as <hi>indecently,</hi> not <hi>congruouſly,</hi> not in that fit manner as he ought to do: <hi>he eats and drinks unworthily</hi> that comes in an indecent manner, without due preparation to this Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall more particularly ſhew what this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy receiving is in two or three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then do we come unworthily to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when we have not a due reverence of thoſe great and ſublime Myſteries that are ſet before us in the Sacrament, <hi>Whoever ſhall drink this cup of the Lord,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: this Cup of the Lord, here is an accent, that it is the Lords bread, the Lords cup; the bread that we partake of in the Sacrament is the <hi>Lords bread,</hi> and the cup that we drink of in the Sacrament is the <hi>Lords cup.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some may ſay, ſo is all our bread; the bread that we live upon daily, is the Lords bread, and the cup we drink of daily is the Lords cup, it is he <hi>that ſpreads our tables for us, and cauſeth our cups to run over.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we muſt conſider, that the bread here ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, the ſacramental Bread and the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Cup, are called the <hi>Lords bread</hi> and the <hi>Lords cup</hi> in a peculiar manner: it is that bread that is inſtituted to ſignifie and repreſent the <hi>Lords body,</hi> and it is that cup that is inſtituted to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the <hi>Lords blood;</hi> therefore when we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſacramental bread as common ordinary bread, when we drink of the ſacramental wine as common ordinary wine, this is a prophanation of this Ordinance. We ought to be ſenſible of
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:99997:250"/>the Myſtery that is in this Ordinance, namely, that the Lords body and his blood are repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by the outward ſigns. The ancient Church were wont to call the Myſteries repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to us in the Sacrament <hi>tremendous Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> O here are tremendous Myſteries indeed,
<note place="margin">

                        </gap>
                     </note> if we rightly conſider what they are that are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in the Sacrament: to ſee the incorporeal God aſſuming a humane body, to ſee God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally inhabit in that fleſh that ſuffered, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that very body of his in which he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, dyed, roſe again and aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be the food of our ſouls, theſe are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Myſteries indeed: and yet theſe are the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries that are repreſented to us in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in the Sacrament we ſee the Son of God and God to have aſſumed a part of our fleſh, and then offering himſelf up in that fleſh a Sacrifice for our ſins: and as we ſee the Son of God firſt giving himſelf for us upon the Croſs, ſo in the Sacrament we ſee him giving himſelf to us. Here lyes the myſtery of the Sacrament: In the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we do not only ſee Chriſt giving himſelf for us, but we alſo ſee him giving himſelf to us; for theſe are no vain words, <hi>This is my body which was broken for you,</hi> ſetting aſide thoſe groſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the Papiſts, That the bread is tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into the body of Chriſt, and that Chriſt is corporally preſent under the outward form of the Elements (I ſay, ſetting aſide their groſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits) there is certainly a real, though ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt to every believing ſoul in the Sacrament. The humane nature of Chriſt indeed is really preſent in Heaven; therefore is it ſaid, <hi>Whom the heavens muſt contain till the time of the
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:99997:251"/>reſtitution of all things, Act.</hi> 3. Yet the virtue of Chriſts body and blood is ſtill really communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to every believing ſoul;
<note place="margin">Corpus ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum in quo paſſus eſt &amp; reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xit.</note> yea not only ſo, ſaith <hi>Calvin, Not only the virtue of his Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, but that very body that dyed and roſe again,</hi> this is offered to us in the Sacrament: theſe are great Myſteries indeed. Now not to have a due reverence to ſuch great and ſublime Myſteries as theſe are, to come to theſe as if they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary things, or to come to them with a common and ſlight ſpirit, this is to come unworthily.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Then do we come unworthily to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when we live in the practice of any groſs ſin, or retain the love of any ſin. We profeſs by our coming to the Sacrament, that we believe that Chriſt dyed for ſuch and ſuch ſins, and yet we love theſe ſins, or continue in the practice of thoſe ſins that coſt Chriſt his life; this is to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the greateſt indignity to the Son of God. This is as if a Traitor ſhould come to ſit at Table with the King to dine or ſup with him, and yet never repent of his treaſon, but retain a traiterous mind and intention in his heart all the while. When a man ſits at the ſame table to eat and drink with another, it is a ſign of friendſhip; no one would willingly admit another to his table, but whom he accounts to be his friend. When we come to the Lords Table, we profeſs the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friendſhip to Chriſt: now when we profeſs the higheſt friendſhip to Chriſt, and yet retain that in our love and practice that is moſt directly contrary to the honour and glory of Chriſt, this is the greateſt indignity that can be. This is that the Apoſtle calls, <hi>the crucifying the Son of God
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:99997:251"/>afreſh, and putting him to an open ſhame,</hi> Heb. 6.6. What is this but crucifying Chriſt afreſh, and making Chriſt as contemptuous as poſſibly we can, whenas we profeſs to expect ſalvation by the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, and yet in the mean time love, harbour, entertain, and practiſe thoſe very things we ſay we believe Chriſt dyed for? Certainly every looſe Chriſtian that makes a profeſſion of Chriſt, and yet lives in groſs open ſins, makes a plain mock of Chriſt and his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for he profeſſeth that he believes he ſhall be pardoned by the ſufferings and death of Chriſt, and yet he continues in the love and practice of thoſe ſins; as if ſo be the end of Chriſts death were, that men might continue in their ſins, and not be delivered from them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then do men come unworthily to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, when they come without examining themſelves. <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. It is obſervable, the Apoſtle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth this examining a mans ſelf to his eating unworthily. In the former verſe he had ſaid, <hi>He that eats this bread, and drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord;</hi> now he adds, <hi>But let a man examine himſelf:</hi> ſo then, if a man do not examine himſelf, then he eats unworthily.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. We ought to examine our ſelves concerning the frame and diſpoſition of our ſouls, whether we be in a fit frame to partake of ſuch an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. We ought to examine our ſelves, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our hearts be ſtrongly bent and inclined to any ſin, whether we be under the power of any ſin, this is the examination of our repentance. We ought to examine what the frame of our hearts is God-ward, whether the bent of our hearts be towards God, and the ways of God, this is the examining of our other graces. Now when we ruſh upon the Sacrament without reflexion and examination of our ſpiritual ſtate, this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy coming. And here let us obſerve, That the children of God themſelves may in a degree come in an unworthy manner: for there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral degrees of unworthy receiving; They that have ſlight and contemptuous thoughts of this Ordinance, they that live in groſs and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſins, they are guilty of unworthy receiving in the higheſt degree. But then they that have true grace, and do not retain in their hearts the love of any ſin; yet if they are remiſs in ſearching into their hearts to find out their ſecret corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, and to judge themſelves for them, they come unworthily in a leſſer degree, and God may correct his own children for their ſpiritual
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:99997:252"/>remiſneſs in this kind. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>For this cauſe many were ſickly and weak, and many were fallen aſleep,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.30. that is, for coming to the Sacrament without due preparation. Others who groſly profane this Ordinance, that come to this Ordinance, and live in groſs ſins, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to live and dye in them, God puniſheth them otherwiſe, he puniſheth them with eternal condemnation: <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf,</hi> or <hi>judgment</hi> to himſelf, as the word may be rendred. The godly themſelves coming in a rude and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs manner to this Ordinance, may and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do bring the judgment of temporal chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon themſelves for not coming in a right manner to ſo great an Ordinance. But ſuch as are profane, who come to this Ordinance, and yet live in ſin, they eat to themſelves the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of eternal condemnation. Now to return unto what we firſt propounded, to come unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to the Sacrament, is one way of contemning Chriſts ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>And if it be asked, What is the reaſon of it, why is the unworthy receiving of the Sacrament a contemning of Chriſts ſufferings? I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Sacrament is a plain revelation and exhibition of Chriſt crucified, <hi>This is my body which was broken for you.</hi> That very body of Chriſt in which he ſuffered, dyed, roſe again, is offered to us in the Sacrament to be looked upon by faith. The Sacrament is, as the Ancients call it,
<note place="margin">Verbum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibile.</note> 
                     <hi>a viſible Word.</hi> The Sacrament declares by viſible ſigns and repreſentations that which the Word doth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. Now as it is a great ſin to contemn Chriſt when he is made known to us in the way of
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:99997:253"/>the Word, ſo it is a great ſin to contemn Chriſt when he is revealed to us by his own ſigns and ſymbols which are of his own inſtitution, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted on purpoſe by himſelf to make himſelf known to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Sacrament is appointed to confirm our union and communion with Chriſt: <hi>The bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt?</hi> 1 Cor. 10. The ancient Church called the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,
<note place="margin">Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum unio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</note> 
                     <hi>the Sacrament of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> becauſe it is that ſpecial Ordinance by which our union and communion with Chriſt is ſtrengthened and confirmed. And our Saviour in effect tells us as much, when he ſaith, <hi>He that eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me and I in him,</hi> Job. 6.56. When we eat Chriſts fleſh and drink his blood, Chriſt dwells in us and we in him. Now when we profeſs the neareſt union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the perſon of Chriſt, and with the death and ſufferings of Chriſt, and we ſlight both his perſon and his ſufferings, this muſt needs be a great ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we heard now how Chriſt and his ſufferings may be contemned, there is another thing that may be added, and that is,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Apoſtates, ſuch as fall from, deny and renounce the faith of Chriſt they once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, they do in an eminent manner pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the ſufferings of Chriſt. Of theſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks in a peculiar manner, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and of theſe he ſaith, That <hi>they account the blood of the Covenant by which they are ſanctified, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy thing.</hi> He that apoſtatizes from the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:99997:253"/>Profeſſion, what doth he do but make a mock of Chriſt and his ſufferings, as if all that he had formerly profeſſed concerning Chriſt and his ſufferings were but a meer ſable. Now it concerns us greatly to ſee that we be not found in the number of ſuch who are contemners of Chriſts perſon or of his ſufferings; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe great puniſhment is denounced on ſuch, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the Spirit of grace.</hi> There is a ſorer puniſhment ſhall be inflicted upon ſuch who deſpiſe the perſon of Chriſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn his ſufferings; and I verily believe this is one main cauſe of the Judgments which God hath already executed, and will yet further exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute upon the unthankful world, becauſe his Son hath been revealed to the world in this laſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury of years more than in former Ages, by that clear and great light that hath broken forth; and yet men make no reckoning of Chriſt and of his grace, but are grown worſe and worſe, more profane and atheiſtical under the light of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that hath ſhone upon them. As Idolatry was the great ſin that God did avenge under the Old Teſtament upon the Jews, that were then his profeſſing people: ſo the contempt of the Goſpel wherein there hath been a plain and manifeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the Son of God, and of that grace and ſalvation which is brought by his death and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, ſeems to be the great ſin that God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging upon profeſſing Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>I Proceed now to another Conſideration to ſhew the greatneſs of Chriſts Love in his Sufferings. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>7</label> The love of Chriſt in his ſufferings appears in this, That the Son of God, ſo great a perſon, ſhould ſuffer ſuch things as he did ſuffer for us. The love of Chriſt doth not only appear from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the excellency of the perſon ſuffering, but alſo from the conſideration of the things themſelves that he ſuffered for us: that ſo great a perſon ſhould ſuffer ſo much ſhame, ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, ſuch indignity as he did for us, this is that which commends Chriſts love to us. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>He endured the croſs and deſpiſed the ſhame.</hi> Iſa. 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair, I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi> That the Son of God ſhould ſuffer ſuch things for us poor men, that he ſhould ſuffer ſuch pains and torments in ſoul and body for us, this commends his love to us. The ſufferings of Chriſt did far exceed the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of any other man; yea, if the ſufferings of all men were put together, they are not to be compared with the ſufferings of Chriſt; and the reaſon is, becauſe Chriſt did ſuffer the very pains of Hell for us, as we have heard. Chriſt did not
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:99997:254"/>only ſuffer from men, but he ſuffered from the hands of his Father, it pleaſed the Father to <hi>bruiſe him, he put him to grief, Iſa.</hi> 53. Chriſt did not only ſuffer in his body, but he ſuffered in his ſoul, yea his ſoul-ſufferings were the greateſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, there it was that he ſuffered dereliction, there it was that he ſuffered the ſenſe of Gods wrath, no ſorrows were ever like to Chriſts ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and yet theſe ſorrows Chriſt did volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and electively undergo for our ſakes. Our Saviour knew before-hand what his ſufferings were like to be, and yet he freely underwent them. Chriſt did not ruſh upon his ſufferings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, but he knew what his ſufferings would be, and yet he was content to undergo them for our ſakes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.50. <hi>I have a baptiſm to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized with,</hi> he ſpeaks of the Baptiſm of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The Lord Jeſus knew that he was to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch ſore and grievous ſufferings, and yet he voluntarily underwent them, he did not rum ignorantly upon them, but he knew before-hand what he was to ſuffer, and yet he choſe volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to ſuffer that which he knew would be ſo bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and grievous to him. It is a great alleviation of a mans ſufferings, not to know what he hath to ſuffer; the contemplation of a mans ſufferings before-hand is ſometimes almoſt as great a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering as the ſuffering it ſelf that he is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go: but yet the Son of God had the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and foreſight in his mind of the ſufferings that he was to undergo for us, yet he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent notwithſtanding to under go them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.21. <hi>From that time forth began Jeſus to ſhew to his Diſciples how he muſt go to Jeruſalem, and ſuffer many things of the Elders and chief Prieſts and
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:99997:255"/>Scribes, and be killed and be raiſed again the third day.</hi> Our Saviour was not ignorant of his own ſufferings, but had a perfect contemplation of them in his mind before-hand, he knew how great and bitter and ſore they would be, and yet he was content to undergo them for our ſakes.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>8</label> The love of Chriſt in his ſufferings appears in this, That ſo great a perſon ſhould give himſelf to ſuffer ſuch things to expiate ſo vile a thing as ſin, which yet he hated ſo much, and had power to puniſh; that the life of the beſt perſon ſhould go to expiate the worſt thing, this is admirable. Sin is the worſt of evils, the vileſt thing in the world. Now that the life of the moſt excellent perſon, the life of the Son of God ſhould be given to expiate ſo vile a thing as ſin, this is admirable indeed, <hi>The Lord hath cauſed to meet on him the iniquity or perverſneſs of us all, Iſa.</hi> 53. Sin is the perverſneſs of the creature, it is the crookedneſs or depravation of a mans actions; ſin is a defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or turning aſide from a right path, and yet the Son of God gave himſelf to expiate ſo vile a thing as ſin is.

Sin is moſt hareful to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Thou haſt loved righteouſneſs, and hated iniquity,</hi> it is ſpoken of Chriſt; and yet though Chriſt hated ſin ſo much, he gave himſelf for our ſins, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Who gave himſelf for our ſins:</hi> and as Chriſt hated ſin, ſo had he power to puniſh and to be avenged for it; and yet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than we ſhould undergo the puniſhment that
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:99997:255"/>was due to us, he himſelf who had power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the puniſhment, and might juſtly have done it, was content to ſuffer the puniſhment for us. Well may we cry out with <hi>Luther,</hi> O the conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion and love of God to wards man! God was the perſon offended, and yet God came to ſuffer the puniſhment that man deſerved.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>9</label> The love of Chriſt in his ſufferings appears in this, That Chriſt had all the Elect before him at once, and ſuffered for all the Elect. It was not for one or a few of the Elect only that he ſuffered, or for ſome or a few of their ſins that he ſuffered, but it was for all the ſins of all the Elect, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Husbands love your wives as Chriſt loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it.</hi> It was the Church that Chriſt gave himſelf for, Chriſt knew all his ſheep by name, and he laid down his life for his ſheep. <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, <hi>He hath loved me, and given himſelf for me,</hi> and every true Believer may ſay, <hi>He hath loved me, and given himſelf for me.</hi> Why, now what an inſinite Sea and Ocean of love muſt there needs be in the heart of Chriſt, when as Chriſt out of the greatneſs of his love gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as a Sacrifice to expiate the guilt of all the ſins of all the Elect that ever had been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or ſhould be committed to the end of the world. This is ſet forth by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world,</hi> that is, Chriſt is not only the propitiation for ours ſins, who do now live and believe on him, but he is alſo the propitiation for the ſins of all others who ſhall live after us, and believe on him even to the end of the world. The virtue of Chriſts death, and the efficacy of his ſufferings
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:99997:256"/>to the Elect of all Ages.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>10</label> The love of Chriſt in his ſufferings appears in this, That Chriſt by his death and ſufferings hath delivered us from that which was the greateſt matter of fear to us. The great thing which all the ſons of men have feared hath been death, and the conſequence of death. The great thing threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for ſin, was death, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> Death was the great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment threatned for ſin: hence it comes to paſs, that all mankind ever ſince the Fall have been under a ſlaviſh fear of death and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of death. The great things which we do naturally dread are death, and what follows death, Hell and the wrath of God. Now Chriſt by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his life hath taken away the fear of death and the conſequences of death. This is fully expreſſed by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>That through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, and deliver them who through fear of death were all their life-time ſubject to bondage.</hi> There are two things which the Apoſtle intimates are the great things that do keep men in bondage all their days: the one is the fear of death; and the other is the power that the Devil had over men, <hi>That he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is, the Devil.</hi> The Devil hath not the power of death ſimply and abſolutely; but he is ſaid to have the power of death, as he is the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner of Gods wrath, and drags men to the torments of Hell. Now Chriſt by his death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from both theſe, he delivers us from the fear of death, and from the power of the Devil. 1. Chriſt by death delivers us from death, the ſtrength and venom of death is ſpent in the
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:99997:256"/>death of Chriſt, Chriſt underwent death as it was the Curſe that was denounced upon us for ſin. Now death is no more a part of the Curſe to a Believer, becauſe Chriſt hath undergone it as a curſe for us. 2. Chriſt hath alſo undergone the pains and torments of Hell, as formerly hath been ſhewed, and therefore he hath enervated,
<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> made void, or fruſtrated the power of the Devil, as the word ſignifies. Chriſt by his death hath taken away Satans power. The Devil after a ſort, as he was the Executioner of Gods wrath, might be ſaid to have the power of death, that is, of eternal death, after a ſort, and in a ſenſe he hath power over thoſe torments which the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned feel. But now Chriſt having born thoſe pains and torments for his people, the Devil hath nothing to do with them, he hath no power over them. Could we contemplate death as we ought to do in the death of Chriſt, we might ſee death to have loſt all its ſtrength, all its venom in the death of Chriſt. It is the obſervation of <hi>Luther: Could we believe ſo firmly as we ought to do that Chriſt dyed for our ſins, and roſe again for our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, there would remain nothing of fear or terrour in us; for,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the death of Chriſt is a certain Sacrament or pledge which certifies us, that our death is nothing at all.</hi> For if death hath executed all its power and ſtrength upon Chriſt; if death hath poured out all its venom and malignity upon Chriſt, then there is nothing that remains in death to hurt us. Death had nothing at all to do with Chriſt, but only as he put himſelf under the power of death for our ſakes. Now the Son of God who was above death, freely ſubjecting himſelf to death for our ſakes, and death having
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:99997:257"/>done all that it could againſt Chriſt, it hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to do againſt a poor Believer. It is true, Believers dye ſtill, but yet their death is not part of the Curſe, the death of the Saints is only a paſſage unto life, and it is that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the way for a more bleſſed Reſurrection. Whatever was truly formidable or terrible in death is taken away by the death of Chriſt. That which was moſt formidable in death was this, that it was a part of the Curſe, that it was the effect of Divine wrath. Now Chriſt having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the whole of Gods wrath for us, death is not inflicted upon Believers as the effect of Gods wrath, nay it is ſo far from being ſent to a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in wrath, that it is ſent in mercy to him, and death is an introduction unto a Believers happineſs. <hi>All things are yours, things preſent, things to come, life is yours, and death is yours,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21, 22. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord, Rev.</hi> 14. Death is an introduction to the Saints unto their perfect and compleat hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: the Saints happineſs is inchoate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in this life, when they are firſt brought into the Kingdom of Grace, and their happineſs is compleat and conſummate in the next life, when they are by death uſhered into the Kingdom of Glory.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>11</label> The love of Chriſt in his ſufferings appears in this, That he came into our nature, and became man on purpoſe that he might ſuffer for us. One of the principal ends of the Incarnation of the Son of God was, that he might ſuffer and dye for men. This is intimated by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>For as much as the children are made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of fleſh and blood, he alſo himſelf took part of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:99997:257"/>the ſame, that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.</hi> It is as much as if he had ſaid, Had he not partaken of our nature, he could not have ſuffered for us; as he was the Son of God, and poſſeſſed of the Divine nature, ſo he was not capable of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but therefore did he take on him our nature, and became the Son of man, that he might be in a capacity to ſuffer for men. O what overco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming love was this! that the Son of God did therefore take upon him our nature, that he might be in a capacity to ſuffer for men: had he always abode in the form of God only, it had not been poſſible for him to ſuffer; but therefore would he take upon him part of our paſſible and mortal fleſh, that ſo he might be in a capacity to ſuffer and dye for us.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conſid. </seg>12</label> The love of Chriſt in his ſuffering may be ſeen in this, Becauſe ſo great benefits accrue and come to us by the ſufferings of Chriſt. Chriſt by the merit of his ſufferings hath purchaſed and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the greateſt bleſſings for us. To inſtance in a few briefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt by his ſufferings hath purchaſed for us the forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt by his ſufferings hath purchaſed for us peace and reconciliation with God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16. <hi>That he might reconcile us to God by the croſs.</hi> Col. 1.21. <hi>You that were ſometimes alienated and enemies in your minds by wicked works, yet now hath he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled in the body of his fleſh through death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Eternal life it ſelf is the purchaſe of Chriſts ſufferings, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. <hi>ult. The wages of ſin is death,
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:99997:258"/>but the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> that is, through the merit of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; ſo that eternal life is the merit of Chriſts death. We have another clear Text to confirm this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.15. <hi>For this cauſe he is the Mediator of the new Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> The eternal inheritance, the inheritance which all the Elect are brought unto in Heaven, is purchaſed by the death of Chriſt; for ſo the Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it, <hi>That by means of death thoſe that are called might have the promiſe of eternal inheritance.</hi> Hence is it, that Heaven is called a purchaſed poſſeſſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntil the redemption of the purchaſed poſſeſſion,</hi> the Glory of Heaven is called a purchaſed poſſeſſion. Now in every purchaſe there muſt be a price, there can be no purchaſe without a price: the price therefore that was laid down for us, that we might obtain eternal life, was the price of Chriſts blood, the death of Chriſt, as appears from the former Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Spirit of God, and all that grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are inabled to believe and obey; and in general, whatever bleſſings are comprehended in the Covenant of Grace, theſe are all the purchaſe of the death of Chriſt. This is apparent from thoſe words of our Saviour in the inſtitution of the Supper, <hi>This cup is the new Teſtament in my blood:</hi> as much as if he ſhould ſay, All the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, all the bleſſings of the new Covenant are the purchaſe of my blood, and the Covenant it ſelf is ratified and confirmed by my blood. Now in the Covenant of Grace there are many great
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:99997:258"/>things promiſed in it: the Lord promiſeth to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the ſins of his people, he promiſeth that he will <hi>put his Law in their minds, and write it in their hearts;</hi> he promiſeth that he will give his Spirit to them, and the like: all theſe bleſſings are purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and procured by the death of Chriſt; great therefore muſt the love of Chriſt be in giving himſelf to ſuffer and dye for his people, ſince by the death of Chriſt ſuch great and admirable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges are purchaſed for them. The Covenant of Grace is the greateſt Charter of all our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Priviledges; whatever Priviledges belong to a Believer, they are contained within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the Covenant. Now the Covenant it ſelf is founded in the blood of the Mediator of the Covenant. How precious then is that blood that purchaſed ſuch great things for us? And how great was the love of Chriſt that ſhed his blood to obtain ſuch things for us?</p>

                     </label> If the love of Chriſt be ſo great in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, let us be exhorted from hence to meditate much on the ſufferings of Chriſt. O it were well for us, if we could take many a turn at the Croſs of Chriſt, and by the eye of faith ſee and behold what it was that the Son of God ſuffered in our nature for us. There may we ſee him ſuffering dereliction, undergoing the deprivation of the ſenſe and comfort of Gods love: there may we ſee him bear the whole Curſe, ſuffering the wrath of God, yea the very pains and torments of Hell for us. We ought to contemplate theſe things, and by faith to realize the ſufferings of Chriſt, and the greatneſs of his love to us in his ſufferings. We ought not to look upon the ſufferings of Chriſt as a ſtory, but to ſee what he ſuffered was
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:99997:259"/>for our ſakes and out of love to us, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our ſalvation. Now the more we medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon the ſufferings of Chriſt, there are two things that will follow thereupon.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The more we meditate upon the ſufferings of Chriſt, the more ſhall we underſtand what thoſe heights and depths, and lengths and breadths of the love of Chriſt are, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite dimenſions in the love of Chriſt, and the more we ſtudy the ſufferings of Chriſt, the more ſhall we ſee what thoſe heights and depths, and lengths and breadths of Chriſts love are. O what immenſe love was this, that the Son of God ſhould come from Heaven to Earth to ſuffer and dye for men! God might have glorified himſelf, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though man had never been ſaved. A manifeſt proof of this we have in the Angels: the Angels that fell were never recovered out of their ſin and miſery, and yet God is glorified upon them; and if fallen man had never been recovered, God might have glorified himſelf upon men in their condemnation and deſtruction, as he is now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying himſelf upon the fallen Angels. Now this was the abundant love of God to man, that God did not only will mans ſalvation, but that ſo great a perſon as the Son of God and God, ſhould come from Heaven to Earth to ſave and dye for man. O let us ſtand and wonder at this love: the more we ſoak our hearts in the meditation of theſe things, that the Son of God and God ſhould come into the nature of man for this very end, to ſuffer ſuch things for man, that man might be ſaved, the more ſhall we be taken up in the admiration of this love.</p>
                  <pb n="501" facs="tcp:99997:259"/>
                  <p n="2">2. The more we meditate on Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and of the end which Chriſt had in his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that he ſuffered ſuch and ſuch things for us, the more ſhall we be confirmed in the belief and aſſurance of our own ſalvation. Chriſt did not ſuffer in vain, he did not ſhed his blood in vain. If Chriſt did indeed ſuffer the pains of Hell, that is a certain ſign that God hath no mind that ſuch as believe in Chriſt ſhall ſuffer thoſe pains. The ſufferings of Chriſt are a clear miroir to ſhew us what we are delivered from. What Chriſt hath ſuffered we ſhall not ſuffer, for God will not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin twice. If God hath inflicted the full pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of our ſins upon the perſon of our Head, he will not lay the puniſhment of ſin upon us too. God indeed may correct his children in a way of fatherly diſcipline, but he will not lay the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin upon them in a way of vindictive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and the reaſon is, becauſe God hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy puniſhed their ſins in the perſon of their Head: Chriſt their Head and Surety hath born the full puniſhment of their ſins for them. This is the force of the Apoſtles argument, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifieth: Who is he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth? It is Chriſt that dyed.</hi> As much as if he had ſaid, If Chriſt hath dyed, we ſhall not dey: if we be Believers, <hi>who ſhall condemn? It is Chriſt that dyed,</hi> that is, if Chriſt hath dyed, we ſhall not dye eternally; if the Law hath had its full power and ſtrength upon Chriſt, if the Law hath put Chriſt to death, if it hath executed the Curſe upon Chriſt to the uttermoſt, then it hath no more to execute upon a Believer as a part of the Curſe; for <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:99997:260"/>the Law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3.13. Therefore the conſideration of what Chriſt hath ſuffered for us may be as food to our faith. Hath Chriſt indeed ſuffered ſuch things, as we have heard of in the Doctrine of Satisfaction, then we ſhall never ſuffer them. Hath Chriſt ſuffered de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliction, hath he been forſaken of God, and that as our Surety, then will God never forſake us for ever. God may hide his face from us for a moment, but he will not forſake us for ever. Hath Chriſt born the wrath of God, then ſhall we never bear it. O when-ever the ſenſe of guilt and the fear of Gods wrath oppreſs our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and lye heavy upon us, the beſt courſe we can take is to dip our conſciences in the wounds and blood of Chriſt, as <hi>Luther</hi>'s expreſſion is; and the realizing by faith what Chriſt hath ſuffered, will be the beſt balm to cure a wounded conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: for if the ſufferings of Chriſt were real, then firſt there is real ſatisfaction made; and if there was real ſatisfaction made, then is God real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pacified and really atoned; and if God be real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied, why then ſhould we doubt and call in queſtion his love any more? Only our great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment is, to ſecure our part in Chriſt, and to ſecure our intereſt in his ſufferings; till Chriſt himſelf be ours, we can lay no claim to the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of his ſufferings, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>He that hath the Son hath life.</hi> We muſt firſt have the Son himſelf, before we can have life by the Son. Our firſt work therefore is to make ſure our intereſt in the Son himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Let me now in a few words cloſe up the whole Doctrine concerning the Sufferings of Chriſt and the work of his Satisfaction. We have heard
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:99997:260"/>much concerning the preciouſneſs of Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and that ample and full ſatisfaction that he hath made by his ſufferings. All that we have heard concerning the ſufferings of Chriſt and the work of his ſatisfaction will ſignifie nothing to us, will nothing at all avail us as to our ſalvation, unleſs we get an intereſt in that great and bleſſed Perſon who hath done and ſuffered all theſe things. That which muſt make the ſufferings of Chriſt and his ſatisfaction available unto us, is to know that Chriſt hath ſuffered as our Head, that he hath ſuffered in our room and in our ſtead. Now we cannot know that Chriſt hath ſuffered as our Head and as our Repreſentative, unleſs we firſt chuſe him for our Head, and pitch our faith upon his Perſon. It is the Perſon of the Son of God who hath done and ſuffered all that in our nature which is neceſſary to be done and ſuffered for our ſalvation: therefore as ever we expect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered in our nature, we muſt firſt direct the eye of our faith to that great perſon who hath taken up our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and done and ſuffered ſuch things in it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one which ſeeth the Son and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life.</hi> We muſt firſt by the eye of faith ſee that great Perſon, the Son of God come down into our nature, and doing and ſuffering ſuch things in it for the accompliſhment of our ſalvation, and then we muſt cloſe with this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and embrace him with both the arms of our faith. It is the Election of Chriſts Perſon that gives us union with him. Now we having choſen Chriſt to be our Head, we ought to contemplate what was done by him in our nature, and to have
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:99997:261"/>all our expectation of ſalvation from what was wrought by him in it; thus ſhall we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the obedience, death, ſufferings, and ſatisfaction of Chriſt, and what Chriſt our Head hath done and ſuffered in our nature (he dwelling in our hearts by faith) ſhall be accounted as if we had done it.</p>
